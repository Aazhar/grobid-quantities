Explicit diffusion is necessary to ensure computational stability. Depth-dependent horizontal and vertical diffusivities are employed ranging from 10 7 cm 2 /s at the surface to 5Ã—10 6 cm 2 /s at the bottom, and from 0.6 cm 2 /s to 1.3 cm 2 /s, respectively. The nonlinear equation of state (UNESCO, 1981) is used. The LSG ocean model is run with 22 vertical z-levels (thickness ranges from 50 m at the top to 1000 m at the bottom) on a semistaggered grid type " E ".
