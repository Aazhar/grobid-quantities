    <p>As a common feature in strongly correlated electron systems including high-transition-temperature (high-T c ) superconductors, the superconducting (SC) phase emerges adjacent to the antiferromagnetic (AF) phase on carrier doping. The AF order parameter vanishes by carrier doping, and the SC phase commonly manifests as a dome in the electronic phase diagram. On further carrier doping, the normal metallic state approaches a Fermi liquid state. This scenario is also seen in high-T c cuprates and several iron-based pnictides. In fact, a very close analogy between cuprates and pnictides such as Ba(Fe 1−x Co x ) 2 As 2 (Ba122 series) [1][2][3] was suggested in the electronic phase diagram [4]. The AF state appearing in an undoped or lightly doped regime is a stripe-type spin-density-wave (SDW) state [5] arising from interband nesting between hole and electron pockets, which is indicative of a superconducting mechanism via AF fluctuations [6,7]. The nesting mechanism is supported by various experiments in the Ba122 series, in which an optimal doping level is located at the AF phase boundary, and therefore AF fluctuations are predominant even in the SC phase. However, LaFeAsO 1−x F x (La1111 series) [8], a prototype of iron-based high-T c pnictides, has an optimal doping level away from the AF boundary and the SC dome is separated from the AF phase boundary, as shown in Fig. 1(a) [8,9]. Relatively high <quantifiedObject id="6e1f90e0-ced4-4213-9703-3996ded5aef0">T c</quantifiedObject> (∼ <measure type="value" ptr="#6e1f90e0-ced4-4213-9703-3996ded5aef0">20 K</measure>) is maintained even in a F-overdoped regime (x ∼ <measure type="value">0.2</measure>). These features would lend credence to an electron-phonon mechanism via orbital fluctuations [10,11], another superconducting mechanism that is in debate with the AF fluctuation mechanism.</p>
    <p>The unique features of LaFeAsO 1−x F x are highlighted by the newly-synthesized 1111 compounds CeFeAsO 1−x H x (Ref. [12]) and LaFeAsO 1−x H x (Ref. * Email:naoki@fujiwara.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp [13]). In these compounds, protons act as H − as well as F − , and O 2− can be replaced with H − up to x ∼ <measure type="value">0.6</measure>. In the H-overdoped regime (<quantifiedObject id="6e67c65b-16cd-4eb1-b60f-146bfa9f9bb2">x</quantifiedObject> ≥ <measure type="interval" ptr="#6e67c65b-16cd-4eb1-b60f-146bfa9f9bb2">0.2</measure>), LaFeAsO 1−x H x undergoes a second superconducting state as shown in Fig. 1(a). Intriguingly, the first SC dome is very similar between F and H doping, suggesting that H doping supplies the same amount of electrons as F doping. The robustness of the second dome was confirmed by ac susceptibility measurements. The SC volume fractions for <measure type="list" ptr="#148d3333-ccee-43a4-b857-ca7dfb5443c2">30% and 40%</measure> <quantifiedObject id="148d3333-ccee-43a4-b857-ca7dfb5443c2">H-doped samples</quantifiedObject> are almost <measure type="value">100%</measure>.</p>
