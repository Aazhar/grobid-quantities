A 20kg ingot is made in a high frequency induction melting furnace and forged to 30mm in thickness and 90mm in width at 850 to 1,150°C. Specimens No.2 to 4, 6 and 15 are materials embodying the invention. Others are for comparison. No.1 is a material equivalent to ASTM standard A469-88 class 8 for generator rotor shaft material. No. 5 is a material containing relatively high Al content. These specimens underwent heat treatment by simulating the conditions for the large size rotor shaft centre of a large capacity generator. First, it was heated to 840°C to form austenite structure and cooled at the speed of 100°C/hour to harden. Then, the specimen was heated and held at 575 to 590°C for 32 hours and cooled at a speed of 15°C/hour. Tempering was done at such a temperature to secure tensile strength in the range of 100 to 105kg/mm2 for each specimen.
