	<p>We represent drug fate in the organism by physiologically based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) ODEs for drug concentrations. Drug effects, outputs of the PK-PD system, will later be considered as control inputs in a physiologically structured cell population dynamic model representing cancer or healthy tissue proliferation with prescribed targets (see Section 3).

	<p>Oxaliplatin is an anticancer drug that has been in use for more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#f4bb2e88-0393-4bf2-a090-a58b9792b59e" pos="left">12</measure> <quantifiedObject id="f4bb2e88-0393-4bf2-a090-a58b9792b59e">years now</quantifiedObject> in the treatment of colorectal cancer. It exerts its action on cells by creating irreversible oxaliplatin-DNA adducts that subsequently yield doublestranded breaks in the DNA. Although it has been shown to induce apoptosis [31] in a manner that does not show major dependency on cell cycle phases (with the restriction that of course the DNA is always more exposed, and thus more sensitive to oxaliplatin insults, in S-phase), other studies have shown that its main effect on cancer cells was likely to be mostly active by arresting the cell division cycle at the G 2 /M, and to a lesser extent, at the G 1 /S transitions [76,77], effects on apoptosis occurring only after a prolonged exposure time. In the sequel, we shall assess these <measure type="value" ptr="#fb4bd82d-729a-4e18-8651-9b7402386a7e" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="fb4bd82d-729a-4e18-8651-9b7402386a7e">main actions</quantifiedObject>, both induced by DNA damage. The effect on death rates will be assumed to be directly proportional to the damage induced to the DNA, whereas the effect on phase transitions, physiologically due mainly to p53 (not represented as such in this study), will be represented by a variable delay due to cells under repair, that will be represented by a specific subpopulation appended to each one of the main phases G 1 and S − G 2 .</p>

	<p>When circadian rhythms are considered relevant (i.e., among teams who practice anticancer circadian chronotherapy, cf. [33, 34, <measure type="list">4750</measure>-, 52, 53]), peak phases ϕ PLP and ϕ GSH for tuned values K 0 and G 0 are fixed according to laboratory or clinical published data [55,75] adapted to human organisms (when observations were performed on mice, it was assumed that <measure type="value" ptr="#038e74be-0424-4947-bceb-a6d6c2ffa10f" pos="left">0</measure> <quantifiedObject id="038e74be-0424-4947-bceb-a6d6c2ffa10f">Hour After</quantifiedObject> Light Onset (HALO) = 8 h, local time, and that Humans, contrary to mice, are diurnal animals). In the simulations presented, care was not taken to optimise drug delivery according to a clinically fixed circadian schedule, since optimisation will be performed freely later, using numerical algorithms and with no a priori knowledge on optimal delivery time schedules. Only the parameters of circadian physiological control functions for the cell division cycle and for the metabolism of the considered drugs will be fixed based on such laboratory or clinical data. Note that in this physiologically based model, circadian rhythms are not mandatory and can be neglected by setting δ = ε = <measure type="value">0</measure> if they are considered as irrelevant.</p>
	<p>As in the previous section (2.1) for oxaliplatin, the PK-PD of the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is represented by a system of ODEs, controlled by a continuous infusion flow j(t), with the help of a continuous flow k(t) of folinic acid, a.k.a. leucovorin, a natural compound of the folate family, that stabilises the complex formed by FdUMP with its target thymidylate synthase (TS) [56]. Also for 5-FU have been experimentally evidenced circadian variations of the target TS and of the main enzyme responsible for drug catabolism, namely dihydropyrimydine dehydrogenase (DPD), such catabolism being processed mainly (<measure type="value">80%</measure>) in the liver [56], which has been considered here as a filter on the general circulation. On entering into a cell, the active form of 5-FU, FdUMP, may be effluxed out of the cell by an ABC transporter [64,72], before reaching its target, a known mechanism of resistance to 5-FU [64].</p>

The ABC transporter MRP8 activity (A) is stimulated by a nuclear factor (N), itself triggered by bound TS. The last track shows the ratio of bound-to-unbound TS, a measure of damages to TS. The parameters used in these simulations (see Section 4.4 for details) have been chosen to produce expected effects, and have not been experimentally identified.</p>
	<p>Due to the chemical forms, always prepared for intravenous infusions (oxaliplatin is prepared as an acid solution whereas 5-FU is usually presented in an alkaline form, hence a risk of precipitate in the infusion line), in which the <measure type="value" ptr="#d51d10c4-0db6-478c-9810-3950f4515998" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d51d10c4-0db6-478c-9810-3950f4515998">drugs</quantifiedObject> are available in the clinic, it is not advisable to deliver them simultaneously. This has led us to add mutual exclusion terms for their infusion flows in the combined delivery to be optimised, as will be mentioned in Section 4. Rather than adding constraints on drug delivery schedules that are actually in use in the clic, we preferred, for computing convenience, to represent the risk of precipitate formation by an added artificial "precipitate" variable in the plasma, with supposed catastrophic consequences for toxicity to a healthy cell population:</p>
	<p>Various models of the cell division cycle at the single cell level exist, some of them with remarkable descriptions of their molecular mechanisms, allowing to study entrainment of the cell cycle by the circadian clock based on upto-date physiological knowledge [40][41][42]44], but they are not adapted to describe proliferation in cell populations, except by considering cellular automata, as in [1][2][3][4]. To the aim of describing proliferation in tissues, we rather advocate age-structured partial differential equations (PDEs), that take into account the main source of variability in such proliferating cell populations, i.e., age in the division cycle. We recall here the McKendrick [61] (or Von Foerster-McKendrick) model for the cell division cycle in proliferating cell populations [11,[19][20][21][22][23][24]66], where n i (x,t) is the density of cells in cell cycle phase i of age x at time t: together with an initial condition (n i (t = <measure type="value">0</measure>, .)) 1≤i≤I . It may be shown [66] that for constant or time-periodic control on the d i and K i→i+1 , solutions to (3.1) satisfy n i (t, x) ∼ C 0 N i (t, x)e λt , where C 0 is a real positive number and N i are eigenvectors of the eigenvalue problem</p>
	<p>In this system of transport equations, <measure type="value">one</measure> for each phase i of the cell division cycle, <quantifiedObject id="40456c04-ac76-458f-a4f2-fd09ae6e0819">the control on</quantifiedObject> phase transition rates K i→i+1 (t, x)(i = <measure type="list" ptr="#40456c04-ac76-458f-a4f2-fd09ae6e0819" pos="right">12</measure>, ) may be decomposed in κ i (x).ψ i (t), using an experimentally identified steplike function κ i of age x [11] and, in the circadian setting, a theoretical <measure type="value">24-hour</measure> periodic function ψ i of time t.The phase difference between ψ 1 and ψ 2 is set to a <measure type="value" ptr="#cf5e1547-c9f9-4c62-996c-f4065af98150" pos="left">half</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="cf5e1547-c9f9-4c62-996c-f4065af98150">period</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#b02bff90-2551-4f2c-8ba9-235114458d01" pos="right">12 hours</measure>) because of the known phase opposition between the clock-controlled proteins Wee1 and p21 [43,60], which themselves control Cdk1 (that determines the G 2 /M transition) and Cdk2 (that determines the G 1 /S transition), respectively. Another (numerical) reason is that, as mentioned in [11], this phase difference has been found to maximise the growth coefficient, first eigenvalue of the periodically controlled McKendrick system; otherwise said, this value of a <measure type="value" ptr="#bf1733e5-6f0d-4e53-af04-f31f24fc7f08" pos="left">half</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="bf1733e5-6f0d-4e53-af04-f31f24fc7f08">period</quantifiedObject> for the phase difference between ψ 1 and ψ 2 yields the lowest population doubling time.</p>
	<p>In this cell cycle model, <measure type="value">5</measure> cell subpopulations are represented by their density variables: n i (i = <measure type="list" ptr="#2b76b014-fe45-448e-9d3a-e6c13dce622f" pos="left">1</measure>, 2, 3) for agestructured phases G 1 , S − G 2 and M, respectively, plus r i (i = 1, 2) for supplementary repair phases <quantifiedObject id="2b76b014-fe45-448e-9d3a-e6c13dce622f">R 1 and R</quantifiedObject> 2 (in which age is unchanged) corresponding to cells subject to DNA damage occurring in phases G 1 and S − G 2 respectively. The durations of phases G 1 , S − G 2 , R 1 and R 2 are not fixed (no upper bound in age, although in fact, they will never last infinitely long), whereas M-phase is assumed to have fixed duration (e.g., x M =<measure type="value">1 hour</measure>) and to always (just by setting high the value of the constant M in the last equation, sending all cells to division at age x M in M-phase) lead in such fixed time each cell in mitosis into <measure type="value" ptr="#1dc76b95-1518-4ae4-ba95-6a15819fa602" pos="left">2</measure> <quantifiedObject id="1dc76b95-1518-4ae4-ba95-6a15819fa602">intact daughter cells</quantifiedObject> in G 1 . We assume that cells in M-phase are endowed with a supercoiled DNA, which make them unreachable by DNA-targeted drug insults, and we have not considered here the effects of M-phase-specific drugs (vinca alkaloids or taxanes); it is certainly possible to represent them by targets at the M/G 1 transition (i.e., by blocking mitosis), but thus far, the M-phase is free from pharmacodynamic effects in this model.</p>
	<p>As regards the <measure type="value" ptr="#8f0bbd26-fe93-4dd2-8e65-22e0309be468" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="8f0bbd26-fe93-4dd2-8e65-22e0309be468">cytotoxic drugs at</quantifiedObject> stake in this study, apart from this last point about M-phase, oxaliplatin is a non phase-specific cytotoxic drug, whereas 5-FU is S-phase specific. Functions L i (t) quantify the effect of oxaliplatin (and of 5-FU for S − G 2 ) on the cell subpopulation under attack in <quantifiedObject id="381c86e0-012b-42d7-8937-5d26d440d745">G 1</quantifiedObject> (i = <measure type="value" ptr="#381c86e0-012b-42d7-8937-5d26d440d745" pos="right">1</measure>) and <quantifiedObject id="66139dac-3e8a-4199-b70a-dff1bac58ebf">S</quantifiedObject> − G 2 (i = <measure type="value" ptr="#66139dac-3e8a-4199-b70a-dff1bac58ebf" pos="right">2</measure>) that can be coped with by repair, whereas d κτi (t) functions stand for the cytotoxic effects of oxaliplatin that cannot be repaired (one can think of them as double-stranded breaks in the DNA [31]), be they occurring in G 1 , R 1 , S − G 2 or R 2 . Note that we have not considered in our simulations (see Sections 3.2 and 4.4, where D 2 = <measure type="value" ptr="#327e3ef6-1283-4e33-a126-8428c5f0cb7a" pos="left">0</measure>) <quantifiedObject id="327e3ef6-1283-4e33-a126-8428c5f0cb7a">irrecoverable effects of</quantifiedObject> 5-FU in our cell population model for the division cycle, assuming that its main target is apoptosis induced in S-phase, probably due to lack of thymine [36], but that these effects are amenable to repair. We do not consider in this model the intra-S checkpoint. Thus functions L i (t) and d κτi (t) together represent the ultimate pharmacodynamics of cytotoxic drugs on their actual targets: the cell division cycle.</p>
	<p>In each repair phase R i , fed from either G 1 or S − G 2 by the corresponding "leak" function L i , damaged cells with density r i (t, x), keeping their age x unchanged, undergo a repair mechanism represented by a time constant ε −1 i . Those cells that have been successfully repaired move back to the corresponding normal cycle phase, G 1 or S − G 2 , and having become normal cells (n i ) again, are candidates to proceed to next phase at the corresponding Variables n i (t, x) are densities of cells at time t and age in phase x in subpopulations, i.e., cell cycle phases G 1 (i = <measure type="value" ptr="#5e241b75-c332-4b69-80d4-651ba32b8c4f" pos="left">1</measure>), <quantifiedObject id="5e241b75-c332-4b69-80d4-651ba32b8c4f">S − G 2</quantifiedObject> (i = <measure type="value" ptr="#ff7ccabf-8649-4c8a-91b4-68b8e8d06ce8" pos="right">2</measure>) and M (i = <measure type="value">3</measure>).

	<p>Additional cytostatic drugs, e.g. growth factor inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), or even antiangiogenic drugs, may be represented in this model for a cancer cell population by an inhibitory effect on G 1 -phase by choking boundary terms at cell cycle transitions M/G 1 or G 1 /S. Indeed, since these drugs are assumed to be non-cytotoxic, taking into account their effect should be done not on death terms, but only on the boundary terms, either n 1 (t, x = <measure type="value">0</measure>) or <quantifiedObject id="fd01d227-3830-4375-896e-90fd08a0f447">n 2 (t,</quantifiedObject> x = <measure type="value" ptr="#fd01d227-3830-4375-896e-90fd08a0f447" pos="right">0</measure>), i.e., in the latter case on κ 1 (x).ψ 1 (t) by a multiplication by (1 − g κσ 1 (t)), where g κσ 1 (t) stands for the pharmacodynamics of such cytostatic drugs (of maximum value 1). This may be achieved by the adjunction of a quiescent phase, as in equation (2.3), that has been studied in detail with parameter identification on cell cultures in [37], using in our case the suggested modifications (2.5, 2.6) of the system. Note that another possible way of representing the action of cytostatics is by slowing down a non constant velocity factor</p>
	<p>To perform numerical simulations, we discretised the PDE model (3.3). We adapted the discretisation scheme presented in [11], Section 3.3 by adding repair phases, transitions from the physiological phases towards these new phases and permanent transitions from these new phases towards the physiological phases. The number of cells in the discretised model is represented by n k, j i = n i (k∆t, j∆ x) and the dynamics of this discretized variable is given for the time step k by n k+1 = M k n k , where n k is the concatenation according to ages j and phases i of the n k, j i s. The matrix M k is a block matrix, where each block represents transitions from one phase to the other. The size of each block is related to the duration of the corresponding phase. For instance, we fixed the duration of mitosis to <measure type="value">one hour</measure>, so that we do not need to consider ages larger than <measure type="interval" ptr="#9e154de3-14fc-4aa4-8362-48ab1b875f75" pos="left">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="9e154de3-14fc-4aa4-8362-48ab1b875f75">hour</quantifiedObject> in M-phase. We give in Figure 4 the position of the nonzero elements for a given matrix M k .</p>
	<p>Focusing on cancer chemotherapy, we propose to minimise the growth rate of the cancer cell population while maintaining the growth rate of the healthy cell population above a given toxicity threshold Λ (we chose in the Jean Clairambault, Olivier Fercoq Combined anticancer drug delivery optimisation FIGURE 5. Gating at cell cycle phase transitions due to circadian clock control. Functions ψ H i (left, healthy) and ψ C i (right, cancerous) define the hours at which the cells of each population (healthy and cancerous) can change phase: when ψ(t) = <measure type="value">0</measure>, transition gates are closed. The dashdotted lines correspond to the transition from G 1 to S − G 2 and the solid lines correspond to the transition from S − G 2 to M. In the model presented here, healthy and cancerous cells differ only by their responses to circadian clock control, represented by functions ψ H i and ψ C i .</p>
	<p>application presented below Λ = <measure type="value">0.021</measure>). Infusions here should be thought of as referring to the drugs Leucovorin, 5-FluoroUracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (lOHP) as explained in Section 2.</p>
	<p>We consider <measure type="value">two</measure> cell populations with their respective dynamics. We model both of them using the same agestructured cell population dynamics model (3.3) but with different parameters. In fact, we assume that the transition and death rates are the same when there is no circadian control, but that cancer cell populations show a looser response to physiological circadian control. More precisely, we model this phenomenon by different timedependencies for gating at transitions in (3.4). For healthy cells, we set K H i (t, x) = κ i (x).ψ H i (t) and for cancer cells, we set K C i (t, x) = κ i (x).ψ C i (t) where ψ H i (t) and ψ C i (t) are given, similarly to the ones in [11], by ψ H 1 (t) = cos 2 (2π(t − 10)/12)1l [7;13]</p>
	<p>recalling from [11] that ε is here a very small positive number (typically <measure type="value">10 −10</measure> ) put in the equations only to ensure ψ H i &gt; <measure type="interval">0</measure> and ψ C i &gt; <measure type="interval">0</measure>, which may be shown as sufficient to imply irreducibility of the matrix M in numerical simulations (see below) and thus applicability of the Perron-Frobenius theory.</p>

We chose, instead of imposing a rest period, to add a toxicity constraint that imposes in a dynamic way that the growth rate of the healthy cell population always remains high enough for the patient to live with a reasonable quality of life, even though he may experience drug-induced diminished physiological functions. In order to be compatible with the periodicity of physiological circadian control, the periodicity of the treatment should be a multiple of <measure type="value">24h</measure>. Numerical tests that we have performed on our model show that a period of <measure type="value">one day</measure> seems to be a good choice, because other locally optimal solutions that we found assuming longer periods finally proved to be all <measure type="value">24h</measure>-periodic.</p>
	<p>But since we have coupled the population dynamics with the PK-PD model described in Section 2, we have to take care that periodic infusion of drugs in the same way results (asymptotically) in periodic transition and death rates in the population dynamics model. In the case of linear systems, the Floquet-Lyapunov theory (see [62] for instance) gives the following condition: if the eigenvalues of the so called monodromy matrix (also called Floquet multipliers) all have modulus smaller than <measure type="interval">1</measure>, then the system is asymptotically stable, and a periodic input asymptotically results in a periodic output.</p>
	<p>One can generalise this result to a T -periodic nonlinear system. For a given T -periodic control u let Φ be the map that to an initial state y 0 associates the state y T of the system at time T . If Φ is a contraction in <quantifiedObject id="320ebdde-93ce-4298-9ba5-3306a7bba20b">the sense</quantifiedObject> that there exists c &lt; <measure type="interval" ptr="#320ebdde-93ce-4298-9ba5-3306a7bba20b" pos="right">1</measure> such that for all initial states y 0 and z 0 , Φ(y 0 ) − Φ(z 0 ) = y T − z T ≤ cy 0 − z 0 , then a periodic input asymptotically results in a periodic output. We numerically checked this fact during computations.</p>
	<p>In our setting, at each time, the control g l (t) is the flow of drug l (1 ≤ l ≤ n drugs ) infused at time t. Here, n drugs = <measure type="value">3</measure> for 5-FluoroUracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin. The discretised control (g k l ) l,k will be the array of the infusion time step by time step and drug by drug. As we search for <measure type="value" ptr="#021f4441-cdc7-405e-a1e4-b5fd10bc36f4" pos="left">24h</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="021f4441-cdc7-405e-a1e4-b5fd10bc36f4">periodic controls</quantifiedObject> with <measure type="value" ptr="#57a25519-2f57-49f1-aa08-f259c9fb083c" pos="left">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="57a25519-2f57-49f1-aa08-f259c9fb083c">drug</quantifiedObject>, we only need to define g on <measure type="value">one day</measure>, i.e. g ∈ R n drugs ×N T , where N T = T /∆t is the number of time steps.</p>
	<p>We need to bound the flow of each drug to avoid evident toxicity. We bounded the flow of 5-FU and leucovorin to ¯ g 1 = ¯ g 2 = <measure type="value">500 mg/m 2 /h</measure> and <quantifiedObject id="79666a1a-6949-41ad-b781-91f2822f25e3">the flow of</quantifiedObject> oxaliplatin to ¯ g 3 = <measure type="value" ptr="#79666a1a-6949-41ad-b781-91f2822f25e3" pos="right">50 mg/m 2 /h</measure>.

	<p>By the Perron-Frobenius theorem [6], we know that if M is nonnegative and irreducible, its principal eigenvalue ρ(M) is positive and is a simple eigenvalue. Moreover, the principal eigenvector is unique up to normalisation and can be chosen such that u(M) ≥ <measure type="interval">0</measure>. In our setting (irreducibility of the matrix and the Perron-Frobenius theorem), one can naturally define a function ρ from the set of nonnegative and irreducible real matrices in R n into R + , that to a matrix associates its principal eigenvalue.</p>
	<p>General eigenvalue optimisation of non symmetric matrices is a difficult (non convex, non differentiable) problem: see [54] and [65] for <measure type="value" ptr="#3440d257-d34a-4bcf-8869-a4ceae90c1e0" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="3440d257-d34a-4bcf-8869-a4ceae90c1e0">algorithms dealing</quantifiedObject> with this problem. However, for nonnegative irreducible matrices, as the principal eigenvalue is simple, this implies that ρ is differentiable. Indeed, denoting by v and u the left and right eigenvectors of a matrix M associated with a simple eigenvalue ρ, the derivative of ρ at M can be written as [46]:</p>

At the end of the optimisation algorithm, we obtained a locally optimal solution for the discretised optimisation problem (4.2) and we reported it in Figure 6.</p>
	<p>It consists of infusing the <measure type="value" ptr="#57c114f3-3649-446d-8633-6e8a6bb7f14d" pos="left">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="57c114f3-3649-446d-8633-6e8a6bb7f14d">drugs</quantifiedObject> in the following order: leucovorin between <measure type="interval" ptr="#d50e283d-28db-453e-bfc2-30be8acf43e1" pos="left">10 h 30</measure> and 21 <quantifiedObject id="d50e283d-28db-453e-bfc2-30be8acf43e1">h 20 (</quantifiedObject>stopping the infusion at 19 h in oder to avoid mixing medicines has a marginal impact on the performances), 5-FU between <measure type="interval">19 and 20 h</measure> and finally oxaliplatin between <measure type="interval" ptr="#e8d513c2-1b75-4ab4-8f7d-b36f3ae8a988" pos="left">20 and 22 h</measure> at <quantifiedObject id="e8d513c2-1b75-4ab4-8f7d-b36f3ae8a988">maximal flow</quantifiedObject>. Then, these infusions are repeated every day until the situation justifies to stop the treatment.</p>
	<p>Without drug infusion, the growth rate of cancer cells (<measure type="value">0.0265h −1</measure> ) is larger that the one of <quantifiedObject id="c6df0c2b-b37b-453a-a9fd-8d81be578757">healthy cells</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#c6df0c2b-b37b-453a-a9fd-8d81be578757" pos="right">0.0234h −1</measure> ), this difference being due to different responses to circadian clock control. This gives an evolution of the respective populations, cancer cells becoming more and more present: see Figure 7. By following the infusion strategy numerically determined by the optimisation algorithm, we obtained that the asymptotic growth rate in the healthy cell population was actually above <quantifiedObject id="5f298be3-be1c-4e1b-9fec-45e54edc352f">the chosen toxicity threshold</quantifiedObject> (λ healthy ≥ Λ = <measure type="value" ptr="#5f298be3-be1c-4e1b-9fec-45e54edc352f" pos="right">0.021h −1</measure> ) and that the asymptotic growth rate of cancer cells was weakened to (<measure type="value">0.0229h −1</measure> ). Thus by this optimal infusion strategy, the asymptotic growth rate for cancer cells was reduced by <measure type="value">13.3 %</measure> while the growth rate for healthy cells was reduced by only <measure type="value">10.0 %</measure>, so that the toxicity constraint is satisfied. This gave us a description of the evolution of the respective populations, which is illustrated on Figure 8.</p>
	<p>If we compare L 2 (t) (Figure 9) and the fraction of the cell populations in phase S − G 2 ( Figure 10), we can see that the best time to cause damage in phase S − G 2 is when the proportion of cancer cells is significantly larger than <quantifiedObject id="a1d98bfc-0466-4585-b6bc-311577649cf7">the proportion of</quantifiedObject> healthy cells in this phase, i.e., between <measure type="interval" ptr="#a1d98bfc-0466-4585-b6bc-311577649cf7" pos="right">22 and 24 h</measure>. The strategy takes into account the delay between the infusion and the effective action of the drug at the cell level due to the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics (diffusion, metabolism and elimination) of the drugs. We may also remark that although the infusion strategy stops infusions for <measure type="value" ptr="#ac9958ee-5822-4da3-ac5b-83f5814dfd66" pos="right">13 hours</measure> per day, the drugs remain active all day long.</p>
	<p>In our cell population dynamics model, the fraction of cancer cells in G 1 -phase is never significantly higher than the fraction of healthy cells in G 1 -phase, so that we cannot tune a significant difference between the <measure type="value" ptr="#04d96355-08cc-442d-b99e-98e96dd536a3" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="04d96355-08cc-442d-b99e-98e96dd536a3">populations</quantifiedObject> in G 1 , and L 1 (t) should remain small to limit the toxicity of the treatment. Hence, 5-FU, that causes little damage to cells in G 1 -phase, is the main drug in this infusion strategy. .

	<p>Simulating the transition from the stationary state without drug to the stationary state with periodic drug infusion (Figure 11), we see that after <quantifiedObject id="6e960c6d-3ce3-4dc1-8612-b3f35177393c">a transition of</quantifiedObject> around <measure type="value" ptr="#6e960c6d-3ce3-4dc1-8612-b3f35177393c" pos="right">10 days</measure>, the treatment performs as expected (λ cancer = <measure type="list">0.02290.021</measure> and λ healthy = ). As mentioned above, by this optimal infusion strategy, the asymptotic growth rate for cancer cells was reduced by <measure type="value">13.3 %</measure>, whereas the asymptotic growth rate for healthy cells was reduced by only <measure type="value">10.0 %</measure>, and the toxicity constraint λ healthy ≥ Λ = <measure type="value">0.021</measure> was satisfied. Note also that the growth rate in the healthy cell population always remains positive, which means that the healthy cell population production never decreases. This does not mean that there is no negative drug effect on this healthy cell population: one should have in mind that we have represented here only the rate of production of healthy cells, e.g., in the gut or in the bone marrow, while for obvious homeostatic reasons, constant consumption (elimination in the intestinal lumen, or release in the general blood circulation) must be considered and should result here, together with this decrease of production, in a decay in physiologically functional healthy cell population (in our example, mature villi enterocytes or mature blood cells). However, since the growth rate in the healthy cell population never becomes negative, the source of healthy cell production is preserved by the optimisation procedure.</p>
	<p>The proposed infusion strategy combines the <measure type="value" ptr="#75f70915-d63e-47ed-9e4c-830549b0bfe7" pos="left">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="75f70915-d63e-47ed-9e4c-830549b0bfe7">drugs</quantifiedObject>. This means that we obtain better results in terms of the trade-off between damage to cancer cells and toxicity to healthy cells by infusing smaller doses of each drug than a larger dose of <measure type="value" ptr="#442a775f-9655-4031-9e9b-3f157131a95e" pos="left">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="442a775f-9655-4031-9e9b-3f157131a95e">single dose</quantifiedObject>. This confirms (once more) that the use of this combination is efficient for the fight against cancer. We shall remark however that the proposed strategy is different from the ones used today in the clinic.</p>
	<p>Firstly, the optimisation algorithm yields a daily schedule consisting of infusions during <measure type="value">11 hours</measure> and <quantifiedObject id="97191050-02b2-4f67-b28a-7689ea9fd286">rest periods of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#97191050-02b2-4f67-b28a-7689ea9fd286" pos="right">13 hours</measure> whereas one usually infuses larger doses and then gives longer rest periods to the patient. As discussed in Subsection 4.2, the schedules that seem to take the best advantage from the influence of circadian clocks on the proliferation of cells have a period of <measure type="value">one day</measure>. However in this work, we did not study the emergence of drug resistances among the cancer cell population, although resistance is one of the main causes of the failure of chemotherapies in the long term. One may wonder here whether resistances are more or less likely to appear when performing short, rather than long, rest periods.</p>
	<p>We have presented in this study what is to our best knowledge the first physiologically based model of action of a combination of cytotoxic drugs, commonly used in the clinic of colorectal cancer, on the division cycle -with consideration of the <measure type="value" ptr="#630adc68-b467-4e4c-bff6-3a56949acc13" pos="left">two</measure> main phase <quantifiedObject id="630adc68-b467-4e4c-bff6-3a56949acc13">transition checkpoints</quantifiedObject> G 1 /S and G 2 /M -in populations of cells, together with the use of numerical optimisation algorithms to meet the question of maximising tumour cell kill under the constraint of preserving healthy cell population from unwanted toxic side effects.</p>
	<p>Also of note, since the model relies on physiological principles, it is <quantifiedObject id="aa0eefd8-c71c-426c-b498-2fd5c0497e48">possible, whe</quantifiedObject>n chronotherapeutics has not proved useful (which may be due to persistence of good circadian clock control in tumours, or to bad and unrecoverable control by the central circadian pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei on the whole organism, impinging also healthy cell populations) to use other pathological differences in cancer cell populations, compared with healthy tissues. For instance, adding to this model a physiological representation of the control by the p53 protein of phase transitions, DNA repair or apoptosis launching, based on triggering of the ATM protein by DNA damage and subsequent launching of p53 oscillations (as presented in [27][28][29][30]59]) should prove useful. Indeed, it is known that p53 is mutated and inefficient in about <measure type="value" ptr="#aa0eefd8-c71c-426c-b498-2fd5c0497e48" pos="right">50%</measure> of solid tumours [74], and thus instead of circadian control, it is possible to use impaired -or not -p53 control to account for differences between the <measure type="value">two</measure> cell populations.</p>
	<p>Finally, one must note that in the present representation, healthy and cancer cell populations are considered as evolving separately, without any population coupling effect between them, except by drugs. The question of evolution toward drug resistance, in particular, and optimisation of therapeutics to circumvent it (see a review in [18]), has led to rather different models of cell populations evolving according to a resistance phenotype, in the framework of cell Darwinism, advocated, e.g., in [38,39] and recently studied from a deterministic point of view by integro-differential equations in [14,57,58,71]. In these models, coupling between cell populations is present, representing competition between cells for space and nutrients by a nonlocal logistic term (in a LotkaVolterra-like setting) in the global -cancer and healthy -cell population. These models are amenable to describe evolution towards drug resistance of a phenotype representing between-cell variability in the cancer cell population. Whether it is possible and relevant to address in the same model such phenotype evolution towards drug resistance and circadian modulation on proliferation -<measure type="value">two</measure> phenomena that do not occur a the same time scale, and not necessarily independently, as the same disorganising mechanisms, present in cancer, that trigger heterogeneity and</p></text>
