This has led us to add mutual exclusion terms for their infusion flows in the combined delivery to be optimised, as will be mentioned in Section 4. Rather than adding constraints on drug delivery schedules that are actually in use in the clic, we preferred, for computing convenience, to represent the risk of precipitate formation by an added artificial "precipitate" variable in the plasma, with supposed catastrophic consequences for toxicity to a healthy cell population:</p><p>Various models of the cell division cycle at the single cell level exist, some of them with remarkable descriptions of their molecular mechanisms, allowing to study entrainment of the cell cycle by the circadian clock based on upto-date physiological knowledge [40][41][42]44], but they are not adapted to describe proliferation in cell populations, except by considering cellular automata, as in [1][2][3][4]. To the aim of describing proliferation in tissues, we rather advocate age-structured partial differential equations (PDEs), that take into account the main source of variability in such proliferating cell populations, i.e., age in the division cycle. We recall here the McKendrick [61] (or Von Foerster-McKendrick) model for the cell division cycle in proliferating cell populations [11,[19][20][21][22][23][24]66], where n i (x,t) is the density of cells in cell cycle phase i of age x at time t: together with an initial condition (n i (t = <measure type="value">0</measure>, .)) 1≤i≤I . It may be shown [66] that for constant or time-periodic control on the d i and K i→i+1 , solutions to (3.1) satisfy n i (t, x) ∼ C 0 N i (t, x)e λt , where C 0 is a real positive number and N i are eigenvectors of the eigenvalue problem</p><p>In this system of transport equations, <measure type="value">one</measure> for each phase i of the cell division cycle, <quantifiedObject id="e63b4bb4-0056-4f34-947b-0e8a918cd3de">the control on</quantifiedObject> phase transition rates K i→i+1 (t, x)(i = <measure type="list" ptr="#e63b4bb4-0056-4f34-947b-0e8a918cd3de">12</measure>, ) may be decomposed in κ i (x).ψ i (t), using an experimentally identified steplike function κ i of age x [11] and, in the circadian setting, a theoretical <measure type="value">24-hour</measure> periodic function ψ i of time t.The phase difference between ψ 1 and ψ 2 is set to a <measure type="value" ptr="#7ed3ffb6-fd9a-4a49-a98f-183466de9004">half</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="7ed3ffb6-fd9a-4a49-a98f-183466de9004">period</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#e08b74cd-386f-4bb6-9b8e-137ca0943ac1">12 hours</measure>) because of the known phase opposition between the clock-controlled proteins Wee1 and p21 [43,60], which themselves control Cdk1 (that determines the G 2 /M transition) and Cdk2 (that determines the G 1 /S transition), respectively.

This may be achieved by the adjunction of a quiescent phase, as in equation (2.3), that has been studied in detail with parameter identification on cell cultures in [37], using in our case the suggested modifications (2.5, 2.6) of the system. Note that another possible way of representing the action of cytostatics is by slowing down a non constant velocity factor</p><p>To perform numerical simulations, we discretised the PDE model (3.3). We adapted the discretisation scheme presented in [11], Section 3.3 by adding repair phases, transitions from the physiological phases towards these new phases and permanent transitions from these new phases towards the physiological phases. The number of cells in the discretised model is represented by n k, j i = n i (k∆t, j∆ x) and the dynamics of this discretized variable is given for the time step k by n k+1 = M k n k , where n k is the concatenation according to ages j and phases i of the n k, j i s. The matrix M k is a block matrix, where each block represents transitions from one phase to the other. The size of each block is related to the duration of the corresponding phase.

More precisely, we model this phenomenon by different timedependencies for gating at transitions in (3.4). For healthy cells, we set K H i (t, x) = κ i (x).ψ H i (t) and for cancer cells, we set K C i (t, x) = κ i (x).ψ C i (t) where ψ H i (t) and ψ C i (t) are given, similarly to the ones in [11], by ψ H 1 (t) = cos 2 (2π(t − 10)/12)1l [7;13]</p><p>recalling from [11] that ε is here a very small positive number (typically <measure type="value">10 −10</measure> ) put in the equations only to ensure ψ H i &gt; <measure type="interval">0</measure> and ψ C i &gt; <measure type="interval">0</measure>, which may be shown as sufficient to imply irreducibility of the matrix M in numerical simulations (see below) and thus applicability of the Perron-Frobenius theory.</p><p>Classically, chemotherapy schedules consist of <measure type="value" ptr="#2705ebcf-e707-4746-8f74-464c2c433b07">several days</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="2705ebcf-e707-4746-8f74-464c2c433b07">severe treatment</quantifiedObject> followed by a longer duration of rest (<measure type="value" ptr="#e84f89f1-0ac3-4681-926d-b0775f0c1eb6">2 days</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="e84f89f1-0ac3-4681-926d-b0775f0c1eb6">treatment</quantifiedObject> every other week for FOLFOX therapy [25], <measure type="list" ptr="#cb521a38-2f71-4a1e-9305-d4e019222f64">4 days5</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="cb521a38-2f71-4a1e-9305-d4e019222f64">treatment</quantifiedObject> every other week or even  days of treatment every third week for chronotherapy [63]).

In the case of linear systems, the Floquet-Lyapunov theory (see [62] for instance) gives the following condition: if the eigenvalues of the so called monodromy matrix (also called Floquet multipliers) all have modulus smaller than <measure type="interval">1</measure>, then the system is asymptotically stable, and a periodic input asymptotically results in a periodic output.</p><p>One can generalise this result to a T -periodic nonlinear system. For a given T -periodic control u let Φ be the map that to an initial state y 0 associates the state y T of the system at time T .

We numerically checked this fact during computations.</p><p>In our setting, at each time, the control g l (t) is the flow of drug l (1 ≤ l ≤ n drugs ) infused at time t. Here, n drugs = <measure type="value">3</measure> for 5-FluoroUracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin. The discretised control (g k l ) l,k will be the array of the infusion time step by time step and drug by drug.

Moreover, the principal eigenvector is unique up to normalisation and can be chosen such that u(M) ≥ <measure type="interval">0</measure>. In our setting (irreducibility of the matrix and the Perron-Frobenius theorem), one can naturally define a function ρ from the set of nonnegative and irreducible real matrices in R n into R + , that to a matrix associates its principal eigenvalue.</p><p>General eigenvalue optimisation of non symmetric matrices is a difficult (non convex, non differentiable) problem: see [54] and [65] for <measure type="value" ptr="#384dee0a-5ab8-4ada-959f-8aa804047b7c">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="384dee0a-5ab8-4ada-959f-8aa804047b7c">algorithms dealing</quantifiedObject> with this problem.

This gives an evolution of the respective populations, cancer cells becoming more and more present: see Figure 7. By following the infusion strategy numerically determined by the optimisation algorithm, we obtained that the asymptotic growth rate in the healthy cell population was actually above <quantifiedObject id="44e9f7bf-636c-49dd-a623-440307902bd6">the chosen toxicity threshold</quantifiedObject> (λ healthy ≥ Λ = <measure type="value" ptr="#44e9f7bf-636c-49dd-a623-440307902bd6">0.021h −1</measure> ) and that the asymptotic growth rate of cancer cells was weakened to (<measure type="value">0.0229h −1</measure> ). Thus by this optimal infusion strategy, the asymptotic growth rate for cancer cells was reduced by <measure type="value">13.3 %</measure> while the growth rate for healthy cells was reduced by only <measure type="value">10.0 %</measure>, so that the toxicity constraint is satisfied. This gave us a description of the evolution of the respective populations, which is illustrated on Figure 8.</p><p>If we compare L 2 (t) (Figure 9) and the fraction of the cell populations in phase S − G 2 ( Figure 10), we can see that the best time to cause damage in phase S − G 2 is when the proportion of cancer cells is significantly larger than <quantifiedObject id="0bbbb9f4-686b-4608-adb6-50780d2ab42a">the proportion of</quantifiedObject> healthy cells in this phase, i.e., between <measure type="interval" ptr="#0bbbb9f4-686b-4608-adb6-50780d2ab42a">22 and 24 h</measure>. The strategy takes into account the delay between the infusion and the effective action of the drug at the cell level due to the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics (diffusion, metabolism and elimination) of the drugs. We may also remark that although the infusion strategy stops infusions for <measure type="value" ptr="#19c96ba9-7e48-4db1-b9af-4a11efb3a408">13 hours</measure> per day, the drugs remain active all day long.</p><p>In our cell population dynamics model, the fraction of cancer cells in G 1 -phase is never significantly higher than the fraction of healthy cells in G 1 -phase, so that we cannot tune a significant difference between the <measure type="value" ptr="#8b8651a2-0a90-429a-bfac-a26863e2df4e">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="8b8651a2-0a90-429a-bfac-a26863e2df4e">populations</quantifiedObject> in G 1 , and L 1 (t) should remain small to limit the toxicity of the treatment.

As mentioned above, by this optimal infusion strategy, the asymptotic growth rate for cancer cells was reduced by <measure type="value">13.3 %</measure>, whereas the asymptotic growth rate for healthy cells was reduced by only <measure type="value">10.0 %</measure>, and the toxicity constraint λ healthy ≥ Λ = <measure type="value">0.021</measure> was satisfied. Note also that the growth rate in the healthy cell population always remains positive, which means that the healthy cell population production never decreases. This does not mean that there is no negative drug effect on this healthy cell population: one should have in mind that we have represented here only the rate of production of healthy cells, e.g., in the gut or in the bone marrow, while for obvious homeostatic reasons, constant consumption (elimination in the intestinal lumen, or release in the general blood circulation) must be considered and should result here, together with this decrease of production, in a decay in physiologically functional healthy cell population (in our example, mature villi enterocytes or mature blood cells). However, since the growth rate in the healthy cell population never becomes negative, the source of healthy cell production is preserved by the optimisation procedure.</p><p>The proposed infusion strategy combines the <measure type="value" ptr="#24ade7ee-b014-4502-b063-5e26ffb85efd">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="24ade7ee-b014-4502-b063-5e26ffb85efd">drugs</quantifiedObject>. This means that we obtain better results in terms of the trade-off between damage to cancer cells and toxicity to healthy cells by infusing smaller doses of each drug than a larger dose of <measure type="value" ptr="#c813f82a-21cf-4f72-abea-b52fc13e5533">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c813f82a-21cf-4f72-abea-b52fc13e5533">single dose</quantifiedObject>. This confirms (once more) that the use of this combination is efficient for the fight against cancer. We shall remark however that the proposed strategy is different from the ones used today in the clinic.</p><p>Firstly, the optimisation algorithm yields a daily schedule consisting of infusions during <measure type="value">11 hours</measure> and <quantifiedObject id="1052f599-ef7d-49bd-ac8e-264c249e4a3a">rest periods of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#1052f599-ef7d-49bd-ac8e-264c249e4a3a">13 hours</measure> whereas one usually infuses larger doses and then gives longer rest periods to the patient. As discussed in Subsection 4.2, the schedules that seem to take the best advantage from the influence of circadian clocks on the proliferation of cells have a period of <measure type="value">one day</measure>. However in this work, we did not study the emergence of drug resistances among the cancer cell population, although resistance is one of the main causes of the failure of chemotherapies in the long term. One may wonder here whether resistances are more or less likely to appear when performing short, rather than long, rest periods.</p><p>We have presented in this study what is to our best knowledge the first physiologically based model of action of a combination of cytotoxic drugs, commonly used in the clinic of colorectal cancer, on the division cycle -with consideration of the <measure type="value" ptr="#61c2adce-0240-48b1-8f98-972d1a77b446">two</measure> main phase <quantifiedObject id="61c2adce-0240-48b1-8f98-972d1a77b446">transition checkpoints</quantifiedObject> G 1 /S and G 2 /M -in populations of cells, together with the use of numerical optimisation algorithms to meet the question of maximising tumour cell kill under the constraint of preserving healthy cell population from unwanted toxic side effects.</p><p>Also of note, since the model relies on physiological principles, it is <quantifiedObject id="222a8868-d8e6-4a9e-82c6-99d18b1c18c0">possible, whe</quantifiedObject>n chronotherapeutics has not proved useful (which may be due to persistence of good circadian clock control in tumours, or to bad and unrecoverable control by the central circadian pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei on the whole organism, impinging also healthy cell populations) to use other pathological differences in cancer cell populations, compared with healthy tissues. For instance, adding to this model a physiological representation of the control by the p53 protein of phase transitions, DNA repair or apoptosis launching, based on triggering of the ATM protein by DNA damage and subsequent launching of p53 oscillations (as presented in [27][28][29][30]59]) should prove useful. Indeed, it is known that p53 is mutated and inefficient in about <measure type="value" ptr="#222a8868-d8e6-4a9e-82c6-99d18b1c18c0">50%</measure> of solid tumours [74], and thus instead of circadian control, it is possible to use impaired -or not -p53 control to account for differences between the <measure type="value">two</measure> cell populations.</p><p>Finally, one must note that in the present representation, healthy and cancer cell populations are considered as evolving separately, without any population coupling effect between them, except by drugs. The question of evolution toward drug resistance, in particular, and optimisation of therapeutics to circumvent it (see a review in [18]), has led to rather different models of cell populations evolving according to a resistance phenotype, in the framework of cell Darwinism, advocated, e.g., in [38,39] and recently studied from a deterministic point of view by integro-differential equations in [14,57,58,71]. In these models, coupling between cell populations is present, representing competition between cells for space and nutrients by a nonlocal logistic term (in a LotkaVolterra-like setting) in the global -cancer and healthy -cell population. These models are amenable to describe evolution towards drug resistance of a phenotype representing between-cell variability in the cancer cell population.
