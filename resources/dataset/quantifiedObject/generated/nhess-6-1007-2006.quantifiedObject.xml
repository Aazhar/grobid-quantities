Besides rogue waves in the open sea, the problem of freak wave events on the shore is emphasized. These accidents are related to unexpected wave impact upon the coast and shore constructions or to sudden intensive flooding of the coast.

	<p>Different theoretical effects have been suggested to explain freak wave events and corresponding models have been developed (Olagnon and Athanassoulis, 2001;Kharif and Pelinovsky, 2003;Rosenthal, 2003). Commonly freak waves in the open sea are the subject of investigation. They may grow due to wave focusing of different kinds: because of the action of external forces or due to the surface wave dynamics. Nonlinear self-modulation is one of the most probable ways of rogue wave generation. It acts in sufficiently deep water, although Chien et al. (2002) report about <measure type="value">140</measure> freak wave events in the coastal zone of Taiwan in the past <measure type="value">50 years</measure> and proceed with <measure type="value" ptr="#81c55e97-741a-4738-a8f1-91aa7275c7ee">175</measure> <quantifiedObject id="81c55e97-741a-4738-a8f1-91aa7275c7ee">instrumental records</quantifiedObject> during 1996. This claims the existence of freak waves off the deepwater areas.</p>
	<p>Impressed eyewitnesses report on these accidents and thus, generally speaking, only hazardous huge waves are in the focus of this kind of study. It should be understood that only some part of observed freak events has appeared in the media. On the other hand, many of them may be just regular storm waves. In interactions of waves with a ship hull or with a seawall, or in cross-seas, just <measure type="value" ptr="#7db53807-052e-41e2-a199-c560b966b14b">two</measure> slightly above <quantifiedObject id="7db53807-052e-41e2-a199-c560b966b14b">average waves</quantifiedObject> may form a very high hump, that generally is not understood as a freak wave. The shape of the hull or of the shore constructions may additionally enhance this effect. The transience of the observation and the lack of information prevent accurate interpretation of the observed waves. It may be considered as a kind of testimony for the abnormal character of the waves that the described accidents are quite rare. They could have been expected more regular if they had resulted from usual superposition and geometries of the ships and coasts.</p>
	<p>We have selected <measure type="value" ptr="#e8229e08-e9b8-48d7-82fc-e91c22ec4fc1">nine</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e8229e08-e9b8-48d7-82fc-e91c22ec4fc1">cases</quantifiedObject> among a total number of <measure type="value" ptr="#4bf29b08-c142-4982-80c1-c1dfe736b15c">27</measure> <quantifiedObject id="4bf29b08-c142-4982-80c1-c1dfe736b15c">reports as</quantifiedObject> reliable and more or less satisfying the freak wave definition accidents.

This division is caused by the significant difference in the ways of observation, available reliable information, and, probably, physical effects. Section 2 is devoted to how we determine and estimate the reliability of the freak wave event on the basis of available data. Section 3 describes trustworthy freak waves in the open sea registered during the year 2005; and Sect. 4 describes selected accidents near-shore. Discussion is given in Sect. 5.</p>
	<p>We have analyzed in total <measure type="value" ptr="#981802d0-17fd-4fdc-9e79-068ab03ba620">27</measure> "freak<quantifiedObject id="981802d0-17fd-4fdc-9e79-068ab03ba620">" events mentioned</quantifiedObject> in <measure type="value" ptr="#1a3c68b9-3447-4e15-be80-304f8f6c8eda">2005</measure> and we have selected only <measure type="value" ptr="#20b1adc6-c727-447e-af95-6db74bb1b1d4">nine</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="20b1adc6-c727-447e-af95-6db74bb1b1d4">them</quantifiedObject> as true freak waves (see map Fig. 1). Their descriptions are given in Sects. 3 and 4 and summarized in Tables 1 and 2.</p>
	<p>The freak waves measured by a device are considered reliable, although even this data may be doubtful (see Forristall, 2005). T<quantifiedObject id="8885f829-a48c-4c15-82aa-2842490cbdae">he way of definin</quantifiedObject>g the peak wave height in a time series is standard: it is the maximum vertical distance between the crest and neighboring troughs. The definition of the significant wave contains some averaging over ensemble of individual waves (the average height of <measure type="value" ptr="#8885f829-a48c-4c15-82aa-2842490cbdae">1/3</measure> of the highest waves in an ensemble) or is based on the processed spectrum of waves. All the accidents collected in this paper are not instrumentally measured. Thus, both the height of the observed freak waves and significant heights should be defined basing on some, generally speaking, indirect information with different levels of reliability.</p>
	<p>ii) reliable registration is proved by direct testimonies: presence of many witnesses, or visual definite registrations of high waves or runups that may be estimated referring to the shoreline relief or coastal constructions. Indirect arguments proving the reliability and abnormality of the wave may be also used (such as the case of <measure type="value" ptr="#2edfa6b4-eb7f-4a4b-b712-f10dbce93ce7">11</measure> <quantifiedObject id="2edfa6b4-eb7f-4a4b-b712-f10dbce93ce7">November</quantifiedObject> in Port Orford (USA), described in Sect. 4, with an aged woman: an elderly lady is assumed to be smart and cautious enough to keep herself far from dangerous waves);</p>
	<p>It is necessary to remark that the manifestations of the coastal freak waves may be manifold, both due to the complexity of the problem configuration and to different active physical mechanisms supporting the phenomena. We cannot confidently classify the observed events, and therefore put them all together. The corresponding definition that marks out some events as freak waves cannot be always applied. Since waves are much more variable in the shore, the estimation of the significant wave height cannot be based on the sea waves monitoring aimed at naval purposes. The direct projection of the freak wave theory developed for the open sea in the case near-shore is also doubtful, because other physical mechanisms may enhance the waves. Typically, the freak wave event on the shore challenges the observers by an extraordinary wave splash or runup, but not by the individual wave height. Thus, the strict amplitude criterion is actually cancelled for the case of freak wave events on the shore in our present study. Unfortunately, in many cases we have to rely on the publications of mass media, such as newspapers and news blocks in the Internet. This information is not always dependable. In many cases the multiple mentioning of an accident is based on <measure type="value" ptr="#c39b6c1f-70d3-447c-9f0e-df9bb1183af2">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c39b6c1f-70d3-447c-9f0e-df9bb1183af2">source of</quantifiedObject> information that cannot be verified. <measure type="value" ptr="#b66cf9ca-30a1-440e-af23-dabcc447fdf0">Two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b66cf9ca-30a1-440e-af23-dabcc447fdf0">freak wave events</quantifiedObject> were observed by the staff of the Institute of Applied Physics (Blue Bay, Russia and Petit Havre, Guadeloupe, see Sect. 4) and may be considered as reliable, although the numbers of witnesses were small.</p>
	<p>There were only <measure type="value" ptr="#39ed808b-2046-476b-8c59-ff8fe4987f5e">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="39ed808b-2046-476b-8c59-ff8fe4987f5e">reliable registered accidents</quantifiedObject> eventually caused by freak waves in the open sea in <measure type="value">2005</measure>.

The descriptions of these events are given below.</p>
	<p>The <measure type="value">591</measure>-ft cruise ship "Explorer" (former "Olympic Explorer") lost power in <measure type="value" ptr="#35cb7a01-770d-4be2-a40e-0efdc9a81e87">three</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="35cb7a01-770d-4be2-a40e-0efdc9a81e87">its four engines</quantifiedObject> when a <measure type="value">50</measure>-foot (<measure type="value">15 m</measure>) wave broke bridge windows, damaged controls and injured <measure type="value">two</measure> crew members. The ship was <measure type="value">650 miles</measure> south of Adak in Alaska's <quantifiedObject id="31a09386-c9bc-4bb0-8431-4f17d3847389">Aleutian Islands</quantifiedObject> about <measure type="value" ptr="#31a09386-c9bc-4bb0-8431-4f17d3847389">1300 miles</measure> southwest of Anchorage. Crew members were able to start a second engine and the ship "limped" to Honolulu for needed repairs. This event is reported by Lemire (2005), in Schwabedissen (http://www.esys.org/news/sos <measure type="list">0501</measure>.html, 2005) and in the website "Events at sea" (http://www.cruisejunkie.com/ events2005.html). The way of estimating the freak wave height it is not certainly defined, but it seems typical to make these estimations basing on the levels of damages and watering with respect to the waterline. Following the significant wave information given in the website "Live Access Server" (http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/LAS) a storm area moving not far from the Aleutian Islands may be marked out. Although there is no data for the day of the freak wave event registration, the maximum estimation of the significant waves during this storm in the neighboring days is <measure type="value">7.2 m</measure>. The "Live Access Server" contains the data from several satellites: Jason-1 (CNES and NASA), TOPEX/Poseidon (NASA and CNES), Envisat (CNES and ESA), GFO (NOAA) with global geographic coverage. The lowest resolution is 1 • Mercator grid. Near-real time data are produced twice a week. The description of all the data, its processing, reliability and data sources are provided on the website. We analyze the data from each satellite and find the maximum wave from all satellites.</p>
	<p>In a bizarre coincidence, just <measure type="value" ptr="#008e4d10-ccc9-40a4-bc89-ea69e7b736aa">two weeks</measure> after <quantifiedObject id="008e4d10-ccc9-40a4-bc89-ea69e7b736aa">the previous event</quantifiedObject>, the ship sister of "Explorer" was damaged by a similar wave (46 ft) in the Mediterranean.

The wave reportedly struck the bridge area and damaged electronic equipment and caused engine failure for a period of time (Fig. 2). A nearby LPG tanker rushed to the scene and stood by while the crew attempted to restart the engines (Landry</p>

The wave flooded cabins, injured passengers and forced the liner to stop for emergency repairs: "It was pure chaos! Our captain, who has <measure type="value" ptr="#df2594e5-8e3a-4764-ada6-c8985bb9a472">20 years</measure> on the job, said he never saw anything like it", as people claimed. This event is widely described in mass-media (see for instance Lemire, 2005;Broad, 2006). The maximum significant wave height in that area on that day was <measure type="value">4 m</measure> (Live Access Server).</p>

	<p>A wave washed <measure type="value">two</measure> people off the breakwater in Kalk Bay (South Africa); both were rescued, although one received serious head injuries (Hunter: http://www.weathersa.co.za/ Pressroom/<measure type="interval">2005/2005Aug31</measure>ExtremeWaves.jsp, 2005). The wave height was over <measure type="value">9 m</measure> (Fig. 3). The offshore significant wave height near South Africa coast was up to <measure type="value">4.5 m</measure> (Live Access Server).

And recently in <measure type="value">2006</measure> on <measure type="value">22 July</measure>, a <measure type="value">60-year</measure>-old grandfather was swept off Kalk Bay harbour (Ndenze, 2006).</p>
	<p>An anomalously high surface wave was <quantifiedObject id="91404c50-61f6-46d3-b02c-1f671e4e1a15">observed </quantifiedObject>in Blue Bay in the Black Sea (near the town of Gelendzhik, Russia) during the measurements of film slicks conducted by the staff of the Institute of Applied Physics, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. The boat was sailing at <measure type="interval" ptr="#91404c50-61f6-46d3-b02c-1f671e4e1a15">40-50 m</measure> from the coast (the depth was about <measure type="value">2-3 m</measure>), when a single large breaking wave appeared at <measure type="value" ptr="#1d8896fe-7744-48a7-b72e-37f3fe39a1c6">15-20 m</measure> from the boat. It exceeded the typical waves about <measure type="value" ptr="#adc21e43-9beb-412c-b6ed-12ce3ca442a5">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="adc21e43-9beb-412c-b6ed-12ce3ca442a5">times</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value">1 m</measure> against <measure type="interval">40-50 cm</measure>), passed the boat and broke at the coast ( Ermakov and Vasilinenko, 2005).</p>
	<p>There was panic at Maracas Beach (Trinidad Island, the Antilles), when a series of towering waves, many more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#8791db5a-3fef-4363-97e4-13bb02212eee">25</measure> <quantifiedObject id="8791db5a-3fef-4363-97e4-13bb02212eee">feet</quantifiedObject> high, sent seabathers, vendors and lifeguards running for their lives (Fig. 4). Around 02:15 p.m., <measure type="value">two</measure> waves, described by lifeguards as more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#852eac54-54c0-445a-920f-87b954d6afc8">25</measure> <quantifiedObject id="852eac54-54c0-445a-920f-87b954d6afc8">feet</quantifiedObject> high, followed each other simultaneously, taking everyone by surprise. As an eyewitness said, "you have waves that are coming in at <measure type="interval">20 to 25 feet</measure> and in between you have sets of <measure type="interval">12 to 18 feet</measure>." The waves raced past the shoreline onto vending stalls, before crossing the roadway and flooding out the car park and bake and shark vendors' stalls on the northern side of the main thoroughfare. Refrigerators, stoves and gas tanks stood in knee-high water inside vendor stalls. The swells, which began pounding the North Coast shoreline at around 11:00 a.m., continued late into the evening. There were reports that pirogues at Las Cuevas, Blanchisseuse and La Fillette were destroyed by the swells (Stapleton, 2005). The offshore significant wave height for Maracas Bay was about <measure type="value">1.5 m</measure> (Live Access Server).</p>
	<p>Grand Bahama (the Bahamas) was rocked by <quantifiedObject id="442435b9-d481-4fda-a22d-a3b0fcf6e6e6">a big wave on</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#442435b9-d481-4fda-a22d-a3b0fcf6e6e6">24 October</measure>. Witnesses describe storm surges <measure type="value">12 feet</measure> (<measure type="value">3.7 m</measure>) high, which swept away more than a <measure type="value" ptr="#c9eaee5c-decd-4d4a-9125-ac8b75b9c875">hundred</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c9eaee5c-decd-4d4a-9125-ac8b75b9c875">homes</quantifiedObject> and killed at least one villager, a <measure type="value" ptr="#982892c4-0209-4791-bf5a-5be682650baa">15-month</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="982892c4-0209-4791-bf5a-5be682650baa">old child</quantifiedObject> who drowned in the sea swells. "This was a massive wave that came in, one that was beyond any way to control it. . . You couldn't do anything with that one.

The consequences of this event are shown in Fig. 5. Although it was a heavy storm caused by Hurricane Wilma, the offshore significant wave height for that day was not very large -about <measure type="value">1.2 m</measure> (Live Access Server).</p>
	<p>One more case happened in Port Orford (Southern Oregon, USA). A wave swept <measure type="value">three</measure> people into the Pacific Ocean, killing <measure type="value" ptr="#4b238dfa-5d4f-40cf-9e51-905a2faaa896">two</measure> and injuring one (<quantifiedObject id="4b238dfa-5d4f-40cf-9e51-905a2faaa896">The Seattle Times</quantifiedObject>, 2005). We do not know anything about the wave that swept those people, but one of them is reported aged. Pamela Flynn was <measure type="value">72 years</measure> old. This should imply that the rogue wave was unexpectedly high. The offshore significant wave height on that day was up to <measure type="value">3.8 m</measure>.</p>
	<p>An unexpected flooding of the Caribbean coast was observed in Guadeloupe (the Antilles) by one of the authors (I.D.). At the point called Petit Havre the coast <measure type="value">2 m</measure> off the shoreline was suddenly covered by water (usual runup is up to <measure type="interval">1 m</measure>); during other 4 h nothing similar happened.</p>
	<p>The major number of observed freak wave events is related to the near-shore zone. This is evidently explained by the greater number of potential witnesses, and a higher rate of dubious accidents. Figure 1 shows the locations of the events in <measure type="value">2005</measure> suggested (dots) and selected (stars) as true freak wave events. The number of accidents near the shore remains greater (<measure type="value" ptr="#f515e769-8a1c-433f-8b7b-e88553dcf779">six</measure> <quantifiedObject id="f515e769-8a1c-433f-8b7b-e88553dcf779">events against</quantifiedObject> threein the open sea).</p>
	<p>All available observations of freak waves in the open sea are made by crews and passengers of large cruiser ships what makes them reliable. We suppose the freak wave on Maracas Beach to be definite, since many photos and evidences are available. The case at the Bahamas is reliable, but not definite because it happened during Hurricane Wilma and could be caused by regular storm waves. The reliability of the accident in Port Orford has been already discussed: it is supposed reliable, although it is based on indirect arguments. <measure type="value" ptr="#d4cd56c7-e439-4fb7-af45-52fbb19298ec">Two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d4cd56c7-e439-4fb7-af45-52fbb19298ec">cases</quantifiedObject> were observed by the staff of the Institute of Applied Physics (Blue Bay and Petit Havre) and are considered reliable. The case in Kalk Bay seems to be reliable, especially if we bear in mind <measure type="value" ptr="#39f063f6-a568-4448-81cb-a168424b6be0">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="39f063f6-a568-4448-81cb-a168424b6be0">other similar cases reported</quantifiedObject> in this bay. The distribution of reported freak wave events (suggested and reliable) during the year is presented in Fig. 6. It is difficult to build statistics on the basis of such a small number of cases, although some regularity may be easily caught from these plots: the accidents in the open sea prevail in winter time, although the near-shore accidents happen during the second half of the year. This should be certainly related to the swimming and tourist seasons, but may have other reasons.</p>
	<p>The absolute heights of the reported waves in the open sea are not outstanding, a little higher than <measure type="interval" ptr="#ff5179b9-32ef-4006-ab7e-2c4401e598cd">20</measure> <quantifiedObject id="ff5179b9-32ef-4006-ab7e-2c4401e598cd">m</quantifiedObject>, but they appear suddenly and significantly exceed surrounding waves. The estimations of freak wave excess over significant waves made with the help of available data show sometimes unbelievable results (see the accident with Norwegian Dawn in Table 1). The abnormality index H max /H significant approaches <measure type="value">five</measure>, although the maximum instrumentally registered value to our knowledge does not exceed <measure type="value">four</measure> ( Divinsky et al., 2004;Stansell, 2004). This makes the available data doubtful. In all I. I. Didenkulova et al.: Freak waves in <measure type="value" ptr="#c0bb0d17-1fb8-4955-901e-0893915c0b29">2005</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c0bb0d17-1fb8-4955-901e-0893915c0b29">cases considered</quantifiedObject> here there was a single wave without precursor and after-waves, except the event on Maracas Beach, where a series of "towering waves" were observed.</p>
	<p>About <measure type="value">ten years</measure> ago it was supposed that freak waves occur much rarer than they are observed: these reports were questioned. Now the turning point is passed, and it is understood that freak waves happen much more frequent than they are observed. Reported cases of observations and measurements for the Taiwan coast (Chien et al., 2002) confirm this conclusion. We tried to collect and classify the freak waves observed by eyewitnesses during the year of 2005. The main goal of this research is to take into consideration different possible manifestations of this phenomenon to be able to comprehend adequately the physics, role and potential possibilities of these waves. The problem of near-shore freak wave events should be studied further, since registrations of these events become absolutely reliable (see photos in Figs. 4, 5), and they cause real destruction and people losses. This collection is certainly incomplete and we would like to stimulate collecting similar reliable cases to be able to understand the physics of freak wave events.</p></text>
