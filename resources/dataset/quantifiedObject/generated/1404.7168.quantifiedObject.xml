We model the dynamical evolution of dust grains from the time of their ejection from the comet nucleus to the Mars close encounter, and determine the flux at Mars.

These uncertainties exclude any collision of the comet nucleus with Mars, yet warrant a detailed investigation of the possibility that the dust coma of the comet may be able to reach Mars.

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations by Li et al. (2014) allow us to estimate the ejection velocity of the dust grains at the µm radius scale, or more precisely grains with <quantifiedObject id="cd886d4f-494b-43bb-833e-16faa3c2d36b">β ≃</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#cd886d4f-494b-43bb-833e-16faa3c2d36b">1</measure>, where β is the ratio between the radiation pressure force and the gravitational force due to the Sun on the grain ( Burns et al. 1979).

In the next Section we discuss how we use these constraints to model the velocity of larger dust grains ejected at larger heliocentric distances, which are in the relevant range for delivery of dust grains to Mars. In Section 3, we present the results from numerical simulations where we model the dynamical evolution of dust grains after ejection from the comet nucleus to their close approach with Mars. In Section 4 we discuss the consequences of our modeling choices and how they likely affect the outcomes of the simulations, and compare our results with earlier works which characterize the delivery of dust grains to Mars ( Moorhead et al. 2014;Vaubaillon et al. 2014;Ye &amp; Hui 2014). Conclusion are then drawn in Section 5.</p><p>The trajectories of the comet nucleus and of the dust grains are determined numerically by integrating the equations of motion, using an efficient numerical integrator with variable timestep (Everhart 1974), and that includes gravitational perturbations and solar radiation pressure ( Burns et al. 1979). The state vectors of the Sun and the planets are obtained from the DE405 planetary ephemeris (Standish 1998). The initial conditions of the comet nucleus are chosen at the time of the c/a, as retrieved from the Horizons JPL system ( Giorgini et al. 1996), and are then integrated backward in time to the epoch when the comet was at <measure type="value">10 AU</measure>, i.e., the heliocentric distance that we assume as the beginning of the activity of the comet. <quantifiedObject id="e5b968fe-3c9f-41b6-9e8f-a06c6c5dbc6b">The maximum heliocentric distance of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#e5b968fe-3c9f-41b6-9e8f-a06c6c5dbc6b">10 AU</measure> is chosen based on pre-discovery images of the active comet at approximately <measure type="value">8 AU</measure>, and considering that the region of <quantifiedObject id="e26f0e1f-3e28-4e2a-90e3-931c0daf0eaa">the sky</quantifiedObject> where the comet was between <measure type="interval" ptr="#e26f0e1f-3e28-4e2a-90e3-931c0daf0eaa">8 and 10 AU</measure> was not covered by surveys (T. Spahr, MPC, priv. comm.). The comet nucleus is considered massless, and grains are assigned a radius and density in order to compute the effects of radiation pressure, and are integrated individually. As a trade-off between simulation performance and accuracy, gravitational interactions are computed only with the Sun, Jupiter, and Mars, and limit the nominal accuracy of the numerical integrator. This causes a significant speed-up of simulations compared to including all planets, and causes a difference in c/a distance of dust grains of <quantifiedObject id="fc14401a-b269-4755-9d80-c9a77c843d03">the order of</quantifiedObject> a <measure type="value" ptr="#fc14401a-b269-4755-9d80-c9a77c843d03">few hundred kilometers</measure>. This is relatively small compared to the <measure type="value">few thousand kilometers</measure> uncertainty on the comet c/a distance, especially considering the statistical nature of this study.</p><p>Dust grains are ejected isotropically from the nucleus, at a velocity that is determined using an empirical scaling law, based on the results in Whipple (1951). This choice is due to the difficulty of developing a d<quantifiedObject id="fc7f490c-0f02-4aec-84cf-7272415f9f4f">etailed</quantifiedObject> self-consistent physical model of grain ejection driven by hyper-volatiles at large heliocentric distances and then water within approximately <measure type="value" ptr="#fc7f490c-0f02-4aec-84cf-7272415f9f4f">3 AU</measure> from the Sun, as such a model would require some mechanisms for the depletion of hyper-volatiles at shorter heliocentric distance, or would otherwise produce unrealistically large ejection velocities. The ejection velocity is:</p><p>where we choose the reference grain to have radius r ref = <measure type="value">1 mm</measure> and density ρ ref = <measure type="value">1 g cm −3</measure> , which correspond to <quantifiedObject id="049f479b-7986-4c4c-8093-43e81ca719b3">β ref ≃</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#049f479b-7986-4c4c-8093-43e81ca719b3">5.76 × 10 −4</measure> , and D ref = <measure type="value" ptr="#707660e4-5d76-49ff-86df-983a71aeb6b7">5 AU</measure> for <quantifiedObject id="707660e4-5d76-49ff-86df-983a71aeb6b7">the heliocentric distance</quantifiedObject>. The value of D ref is chosen to be approximately halfway between the comet activation and the comet close encounter with Mars. Since these reference values are fixed for all simulations, we have v ref as the only free parameter characterizing the ejection velocity of all grains within each simulation. Because of the lack of an estimate of the nucleus size, we consider the ejection velocities defined outside of the gravitational influence region of the nucleus. In Figure 1 we show how the velocities from our modeling compare to the observed HST velocities. The <measure type="value">three</measure> HST observations ( Li et al. 2014) indicate velocities of micron-size grains roughly compatible with <quantifiedObject id="c079de6e-4e58-478f-881d-fad96010eadd">v ref between</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#c079de6e-4e58-478f-881d-fad96010eadd">0.8 and 1.0 m/s</measure>. Because of the significant dispersion in the velocity range, and the limited number of HST observations, we choose not to fit the exponent of the heliocentric distance D in Eq. (1) and instead scale all velocities as D −1 and use different values of v ref to sample different points of the ejection velocity distribution. Values of v ref above the HST range are reasonable if we include a high-velocity tail of the distribution due for example to jets. As such, high v ref values would be representative only of a <measure type="value">few-percent</measure> of the total grains.</p><p>The density of dust grains ejected from comets depends strongly on what they are made up of and the bulk porosity of such dust grains. In the literature we find estimates as low as approximately <measure type="value" ptr="#67f53c60-8323-4add-a88e-c0c821df9757">0.1 g/cm 3</measure> (Greenberg &amp; Li 1999), and as high as approximately 2 g/cm 3 for <quantifiedObject id="67f53c60-8323-4add-a88e-c0c821df9757">interplanetary dust particles</quantifiedObject> ( Love et al. 1994), although that may not necessarily be representative of cometary dust. In our simulations we use a grain density of <measure type="value">1.0 g/cm 3</measure> and provide scaling laws to different densities for all the main results.</p><p>The size-frequency distribution (SFD) and production rate Q of grains are assigned during post-pro<quantifiedObject id="862596fc-417a-42d2-9efe-14b0b240b909">cessing of the </quantifiedObject>simulations. First, we used a uniform distribution (in log scale) in grain radius between <measure type="interval" ptr="#862596fc-417a-42d2-9efe-14b0b240b909">1 µm to 10 cm</measure> during the simulations, and a constant production rate. Then in post-processing each simulated grain is scaled up to represent a far larger number of real grains, according to the specific SFD and Q distributions selected. The SFD is parameterized using the differential distribution dQ/dr ∝ r −a and Q depends on the heliocentric distance as Q ∝ D −2 . The index a for cometary dust grains depends on many factors including the heliocentric distance, the specific comet, and the specific grain sizes under consideration (e.g., Hanner &amp; Bradley 2004;Fulle 2004, and references therein). However, many authors find that adopting a single power law index is convenient for modeling purposes although there are a number of counter examples against this approach (e.g., comet 1P/Halley, comet 2P/Encke). Therefore, as a compromise, we adopt the values of <measure type="list">3.54</measure> and  for a, which are representative of many comets based on dust tail modeling (Fulle 2004, and references therein).</p><p>The flux of grains at Mars is determined from simulations after accounting for SFD and Q, by tracking the grains which come within <measure type="interval" ptr="#3870ba84-e40e-4519-b467-95a1e9d0c8ce">3,400 km</measure> from <quantifiedObject id="3870ba84-e40e-4519-b467-95a1e9d0c8ce">the center</quantifiedObject> of Mars.

The properties of the grains are assumed to be uniform within each bin.</p><p>We performed several simulations, each one with a different v ref value. In each simulation, we generated <measure type="value">five million grains</measure> and tracked their trajectory as described in Section 2. Typically only a <measure type="interval">few hundred to a thousand</measure> simulated grains cross the Mars volume, which we approximate with <quantifiedObject id="0f38ff7f-b62e-45ee-8510-09ee9481818a">a sphere of</quantifiedObject> radius <measure type="value" ptr="#0f38ff7f-b62e-45ee-8510-09ee9481818a">3,400 km</measure>. In preliminary simulations we used a grain radius between <measure type="interval">10 −6 and 10 −1 meter</measure>, and then reduced this range to <measure type="interval">10 −4 to 10 −2 meter</measure>, as this is the relevant range for Mars collisions, see Figure 2. Note how the increased velocity of grains causes a wider range in Fig. 2.-Distribution of grain radius and arrival time (in hours) relative to the nucleus close approach time. The displayed values are for <quantifiedObject id="a943f15e-4a2b-4757-837a-fba443cfa8ce">grains with</quantifiedObject> density ρ ref = <measure type="value" ptr="#a943f15e-4a2b-4757-837a-fba443cfa8ce">1 g cm −3</measure> .

At the highest velocity tested of v ref = <measure type="value" ptr="#d067488f-a2df-440e-9d99-80ae2f7ba718">3.0 m/s</measure> we start to see smaller grains arriving at <quantifiedObject id="d067488f-a2df-440e-9d99-80ae2f7ba718">early times</quantifiedObject>, and this effect becomes dominant at higher velocities.

The figure provides the fluence values for all ejected grains at the given v ref value. However, as we have discussed above, HST observations indicate lower velocities at which no grains intercept Mars. The way to interpret these plots is then to assume that while the v ref parameter from HST indicates the velocity of the bulk of the grains, it is possible that the velocity distribution of grains contains an high-velocity tail, so that only a <measure type="value">few-percent</measure> of the grains will have these higher velocities. Processes responsible for this could be the presence of jets, or the shape of the nucleus causing non-uniformities in the gas flow and in the acceleration of grains from the surface. In view of this interpretation, the fluence values in Figure 4 should be decreased by several orders of magnitude as we move to higher values of v ref , to reflect the smaller and smaller fraction of grains which could be in the high-velocity tail. As a result, the fluence decreases by approximately <measure type="value" ptr="#805a1dd5-26cc-4f29-b2a9-acd0406edf7b">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="805a1dd5-26cc-4f29-b2a9-acd0406edf7b">orders of</quantifiedObject> magnitude at <quantifiedObject id="68f18e3d-ca20-404a-88d2-0a9b2b9144a2">v ref</quantifiedObject> ≃ <measure type="value" ptr="#68f18e3d-ca20-404a-88d2-0a9b2b9144a2">1.5 m/s</measure> and by several orders of magnitude at higher v ref values, to obtain a maximum fluence of <quantifiedObject id="9be8842a-23b3-43e8-8527-d8278f0f8b34">the order of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#9be8842a-23b3-43e8-8527-d8278f0f8b34">10 −7 grains/m 2</measure> .</p><p>The radiant of the dust grains is at <quantifiedObject id="0fc25df5-8943-4be8-a53f-e4515ff935bb">R.A.</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#0fc25df5-8943-4be8-a53f-e4515ff935bb">41.1 •</measure> and Dec. <measure type="value">−15.5 •</measure> in the constellation Cetus.

In their model, the comet orbit solution was not yet as constrained as ours, the grain densities used (<measure type="value">0.1 g/cm 3</measure> ) are relatively low, and the ejection velocities appear significantly higher than what we used. We find that the modeling details and parameters in Moorhead et al. (2014) are not supported by observations such as we used in our work, and the large difference in fluence is a direct consequence of very different models.</p><p>In Vaubaillon et al. (2014), <measure type="value" ptr="#6f2beba0-c98c-4c08-acb9-c28ee4c24e8f">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="6f2beba0-c98c-4c08-acb9-c28ee4c24e8f">different numerical approaches</quantifiedObject> are used to obtain a count fluence of <measure type="value">3.5 m −2</measure> , with grains reaching Mars over a <measure type="value" ptr="#d4517008-d5d7-4d21-b417-15fabf0337a5">five hours</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d4517008-d5d7-4d21-b417-15fabf0337a5">period</quantifiedObject> centered at <measure type="value">20 UT</measure>.

They obtain no collisions with Mars at the nominal grain velocities, and fluence similar to ours if the grain velocity is increased, after accounting for different parameters (density and SFD index).</p><p>Although the peak timing tends to shorter delays after c/a at high v ref values (see Figure 3), the strong attenuation from the velocity distribution causes the v ref ≃ <measure type="value">1.5 m/s</measure> timing to dominate, with a peak between <measure type="interval" ptr="#c00a4248-bfda-4c09-8d0c-75b109134f07">90 and 100 minutes</measure> after <quantifiedObject id="c00a4248-bfda-4c09-8d0c-75b109134f07">c/a</quantifiedObject>. The timings provided in this paper refer to the current estimate of the c/a time as indicated in the Introduction, and will not change even if the nucleus c/a will change due to possible strong non-gravitational forces which may become important in the last few months before c/a ( Farnocchia et al. 2014). As a matter of fact, Farnocchia et al. (2014) show that non-gravitational perturbations may become relevant only when approaching the perihelion, The sub-solar point is just <measure type="value">two degrees</measure> beyond the edge of Mars. The Opportunity rover (MER-B) will be in favorable position for possible observations but in daylight.</p><p>We have presented the results of our dynamical model for the delivery of dust grains ejected from the nucleus of comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) to Mars. Direct extrapolation of the grain ejection velocity from HST observations indicates that the bulk of the grains will likely miss Mars. If we include the possibility of a <measure type="value">few-percent</measure> of the grains to have higher velocities, we find that millimeter radius grains ejected at <measure type="interval" ptr="#3501d091-9645-4506-9f77-3e05ef2603e7">9</measure> <quantifiedObject id="3501d091-9645-4506-9f77-3e05ef2603e7">AU</quantifiedObject> or more from the Sun will collide with Mars. At higher velocities, younger grains from <measure type="interval">sub-millimeter to several millimeter</measure> can reach Mars too.
