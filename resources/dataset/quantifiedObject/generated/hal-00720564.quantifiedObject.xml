	<p>A windsurfing competition was organized in the Olympic games for the first time in <measure type="value">1984</measure>. For the <measure type="value" ptr="#c3740818-6e34-4fa2-abd0-f3fb329c63fe" pos="left">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c3740818-6e34-4fa2-abd0-f3fb329c63fe">first Olympics</quantifiedObject> (Los Angeles 1984, Seoul 1988, and Barcelona 1992) the international racing rules did not allow for open or unlimited ''pumping''. Windsurfing was then usually classified as a ''technical'' sport. Since November 1992, ''pumping'' has been allowed in all Olympic windsurfing competitions (De Vito et al. 1997;Gue´velGue´vel et al. 1999;ISAF;Vogiatzis et al. 2002). The action of pumping consists of moving the rig repeatedly in order to add an extra propulsion to the board, allowing the windsurfer to reach higher speeds and obtain a better result. Since then, the importance of physical training has taken up a larger part of the windsurfers' overall training program (De Vito et al. 1997;Gue´velGue´vel et al. 1999;Vogiatzis et al. 2002). Indeed, pumping requires the windsurfer to perform successive flexion-extension movements of the upper and lower limbs during an entire race, which usually lasts $<measure type="value">25</measure>-<measure type="interval">50 min</measure> (Gue´velGue´vel et al. 2000). In this context, Gue´vel Gue´vel et al. (1999) has shown that mean windsurfing racing HR in elite athletes was higher than <measure type="value" ptr="#99fee94d-fa35-4675-b8af-ddb3030fd600" pos="right">80%</measure> of maximum heart rate (HR max ) with higher values for light wind with respect to moderate wind conditions [87.4 (<measure type="value">4.3)%</measure> vs. <measure type="list">82.9</measure> (<measure type="value" ptr="#c29338e4-e888-4a97-b653-8217c2e7b423" pos="right">5.3)%</measure> of HR max , respectively] for races that were usually longer than <measure type="value">30 min</measure>. De Vito et al. (1997) have observed even higher values reaching <measure type="value" ptr="#3cbf0ae0-a736-4cfd-976d-b1c3a4591c32" pos="right">92%</measure> of HR max and concluded that the windsurfers could be considered as endurance athletes. This was further confirmed by Vogiatzis et al. (2002). It has also been suggested that the ability of the windsurfer to maintain continuous pumping for the whole race duration is an important factor for performance under conditions of light or medium wind (Gue´velGue´vel et al. 2000).</p>

The races with too much wind variation switching from LW to MW were excluded from the analysis.

No changes in the usual racing procedure were required for the purposes of the experiment. As not all studied subjects participated in all the races, the analysis was of data from <measure type="value" ptr="#fd982445-97c6-4fdd-a28f-342e0d3699fd" pos="left">61</measure> <quantifiedObject id="fd982445-97c6-4fdd-a28f-342e0d3699fd">individual races in</quantifiedObject> LW and <measure type="value" ptr="#78c9b2a2-0ca8-48e2-afc2-c13524762e38" pos="right">82</measure> in MW. At the end of each race the athletes were awarded classification points according to the current international rules (ISAF), i.e. <measure type="value" ptr="#39233983-6b7a-4606-82b9-d018c6fb9bb3" pos="left">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="39233983-6b7a-4606-82b9-d018c6fb9bb3">point for</quantifiedObject> first place, <measure type="value" ptr="#c4afb4c0-4962-4816-846a-c2e257c6c54a" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c4afb4c0-4962-4816-846a-c2e257c6c54a">points for</quantifiedObject> second, and so on. Each subject wore their HR monitor on land before their warm-up period. For each individual, the exact time of the start of the HR recording was noted. Each race was accurately timed with its strategic events, i.e. fleet start and individual finish. Then for each subject, the racing HR was isolated from the preand post-race HRs. The mean racing durations were <measure type="value">26 min</measure> <measure type="value">45 s</measure> (<measure type="value">5 min 25 s</measure>) and <measure type="value">40 min 45 s</measure> (<measure type="value">9 min 2 s</measure>) in LW and MW, respectively. As international windsurfing rules allow only <measure type="value">10 min</measure> for the fleet to complete the race after the winner's finish, the maximum difference of race duration between the athletes studied was <measure type="value">6 min</measure> <measure type="value">40 s</measure> and <measure type="interval">8 min 10 s</measure> in LW and MW respectively.</p>
	<p>On-sea HR measurements HR was monitored with a HR monitor (Polar Vantage, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland). The monitor consists of an electrode belt worn around the chest, a transmitter, and a wrist-mounted receiver. The sampling rate was set at <measure type="value">0.2 Hz</measure>.</p>

Blood lactate concentration was subsequently measured using an enzymatic method (Microzym L, Setric Ge´nieGe´nie Industriel, Toulouse, France).</p>
	<p>During the competitive period, each subject came to the laboratory to perform a maximal graded exercise test. The tests were performed in <quantifiedObject id="7f76dca1-05bc-4eb3-97a6-6c0c5ff3a125">the afternoon from</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#7f76dca1-05bc-4eb3-97a6-6c0c5ff3a125" pos="right">2 pm</measure> to 5 pm at <quantifiedObject id="70d3533b-5bd5-4c3a-9242-b7c7d3208ccc">a laboratory temperature of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#70d3533b-5bd5-4c3a-9242-b7c7d3208ccc" pos="right">20°C to 22°C</measure>. The subjects were asked to abstain from: (1) exercise the day prior to the test and (2) drinking caffeine beverages on the day of the test.</p>
	<p>A maximal graded exercise test on a treadmill allowed us to mea<quantifiedObject id="1a2a2eb0-c834-4ed2-b9a9-f8508a5ffc3f">sure the subjec</quantifiedObject>ts' maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2max ).

Then the test was performed on a 0 graded treadmill (Woodway, Ergo XELG 90, Weil, Germany). It began with a <measure type="value" ptr="#d2b3d3d6-faba-4039-85e4-f998c79a7139" pos="left">3-min</measure> warm-<quantifiedObject id="d2b3d3d6-faba-4039-85e4-f998c79a7139">up period</quantifiedObject> at <measure type="value" ptr="#cb931fb1-2d1d-4a0d-b2af-1e6395d828e1" pos="left">9 kmAEh -1</measure> , immediately followed by 1 kmAEh -1 increment every <quantifiedObject id="cb931fb1-2d1d-4a0d-b2af-1e6395d828e1">minute</quantifiedObject> till exhaustion. Oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) was considered maximal (VO 2max ) if the following criteria were achieved: (1) a levelling off of VO 2 despite a treadmill speed increase; (2) a respiratory gas exchange ratio higher than <measure type="interval">1.1</measure>, and (3) attainment of age theoretical HR max ±5 bpm. All the subjects achieved physiological criteria for VO 2max . The peak HR attained at exhaustion during maximal graded exercise was considered to be HR max ( Chamari et al. 1995). Exhaustion occurred within <measure type="interval" ptr="#64fd3981-46ca-4917-a30c-08f69f7b6fe3" pos="right">10-15 min</measure> of exercise for all subjects.</p>
	<p>The measurement of the cardiorespiratory variables was performed with a breath-by-breath cardiorespiratory device (ZAN 680, Oberthulba, Germany). This system allowed the continuous measurement of HR, pulmonary gas exchange, and ventilation during the test. Prior to each test the gas analysers were calibrated with gases of known concentrations. The ventilatory membrane was calibrated with a <measure type="value" ptr="#8f8a0c05-7f47-462b-885e-8af809c669ed" pos="left">1-l</measure> <quantifiedObject id="8f8a0c05-7f47-462b-885e-8af809c669ed">syringe</quantifiedObject>.

(1986).</p>
	<p>For the maximal graded exercise, the following values were selected: v Peak (treadmill peak velocity attained at exhaustion in the VO 2max trial), the first and second ventilatory thresholds expressed as a percentage of VO 2max (Th1 vent % VO 2max and Th2 vent % VO 2max , respectively). As Paavolaı¨nen Paavolaı¨nen et al. (1999) have shown that peak treadmill velocity is more correlated to endurance performance than VO 2max , VO 2max,demand was calculated as proposed by the American College of Sports Medicine (1986): VO 2max,demand (mlAEkg )1AE min )1 )=12AEv (mAEs )1 )+3.5 (with <measure type="value" ptr="#76707ce5-35c0-4c83-a500-91a8e6e3a6d4" pos="left">0</measure> <quantifiedObject id="76707ce5-35c0-4c83-a500-91a8e6e3a6d4">graded treadmill</quantifiedObject>), where v is peak treadmill velocity.</p>
	<p>Values are expressed as mean (standard deviation). A Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis were performed between the mean HRs measured during the races and: (1) performance (number of points obtained), the athlete's body mass, and race duration, and (2) the physiological variables measured at the laboratory. A linear regression analysis was realized between the racing HR and performance. With respect to the relationship between racing HR and the physiological variables, a forward stepwise multiple regression analysis was realized in order to establish which of the measured variables better explained the racing HR. The independent variables used in this analysis were the parameters of the VO 2max test, i.e.VO 2max , v Peak , Th1 vent % VO 2max , and Th2 vent % VO 2max . Statistical significance was fixed at the p&lt;<measure type="interval" ptr="#242b6a6f-e656-4e71-8a94-2b48559ab665" pos="left">0.05</measure> <quantifiedObject id="242b6a6f-e656-4e71-8a94-2b48559ab665">level</quantifiedObject>.</p>

	<p>Despite the possible effect of some non-physiological variables on HR and the fact that HR measurement is an indirect estimation of the cardiorespiratory responses, it is widely admitted that this variable is a good indicator of continuous exercise intensity (ACSM 1978;Le´gerLe´ger 1994). It has been shown that the HR expressed as a percentage of HR max is more representative of exercise intensity than the absolute HR value ( Gilman and Wells 1993;Londeree et al. 1995). Furthermore, when expressed as a percentage of HR reserve , i.e. HR max -HR rest , the HR was closely related to VO 2 in continuous exercise (Gilman 1996). It has recently been shown that even if the exercise pattern is intermittent, in long aerobic exercise such as tennis, HR time course is similar to that of VO 2 ( Dansou et al. 2001). The present results show that the subjects sailed with HRs representing <measure type="list">80.5 and 76.2%87.482.9</measure>HR max in LW and MW, respectively. This is slightly lower than values reported by Gue´vel Gue´vel et al. (1999), namely  and %HRmax, respectively. This may not be due to race duration, as HR was not correlated to race duration in either study. De Vito et al. (1997) have reported even higher values representing about <measure type="value">92%</measure> HR max , but these values were measured over short periods of time in a race simulation. The slightly lower %HR max values observed in the present study may not be explained by the presence of a female windsurfer in the group, as De Vito et al. (1997) and Vogiatzis et al. (2002) have shown similar %HR max in male and female athletes when pumping. A possible cause of the lower relative HRs could be due to the pumping pattern of the studied subjects. Gue´vel Gue´vel et al. (2000) have shown that <measure type="value" ptr="#861e471a-9861-4ce7-a296-b070984de00d" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="861e471a-9861-4ce7-a296-b070984de00d">periods of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value">6-minutes</measure> simulated pumping with <measure type="value" ptr="#5c520825-aac1-4dc5-8b11-e4b2a1a48304" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5c520825-aac1-4dc5-8b11-e4b2a1a48304">frequencies</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="list" ptr="#e28063f5-c732-417d-b4ce-d00f50440663" pos="right">1.5 vs. 1 Hz77.180.2</measure>) with the same energy expenditure, resulted in a cardiac response representing  and %HRmax respectively. The time to exhaustion (in a separate test) was <measure type="value">threefold</measure> longer for the short and frequent pumping with respect to the high amplitude one. It is then possible that the present study subjects used more the short pumping than the subjects of Gue´vel Gue´vel et al. (1999). It has been reported that if high magnitude pumping is more strenuous, it is more effective at increasing board speed (Gue´velGue´vel et al. 2000). Lastly, an experimental difference could have caused the observed discrepancies in racing intensity, as Gue´vel Gue´vel et al. (1999) only analysed the first race of each competition day. The present study analysed all the races sailed for a given day, which corresponded to <measure type="interval" ptr="#430ce5ab-ec74-476a-9fe0-05dc67c2e2c2" pos="left">two to three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="430ce5ab-ec74-476a-9fe0-05dc67c2e2c2">races</quantifiedObject> a day with <measure type="interval" ptr="#73c4aaa2-546a-4589-a086-cc9af5580f2e" pos="right">15-20 min</measure> of recovery in between.

	<p>The exercise HR increases could be due to: (1) the exercise intensity per se and/or (2) to the type of muscle contractions. Indeed, De Vito et al. (1997) have noted that windsurfing is a mix of dynamic (e.g. arms, thighs) and static (e.g. trunk and forearms) contractions. Furthermore, the effect of the raised upper arms on the HR increase has to be considered (De Vito et al. 1997). As the races lasted for more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#018858bd-70e8-462a-81a9-14311973e35e" pos="left">20</measure> <quantifiedObject id="018858bd-70e8-462a-81a9-14311973e35e">min</quantifiedObject> it is possible that cardiac drift also influenced the averaged HR values (Gilman 1996).</p>
	<p>With respect to the relationship between sailing HRs and laboratory variables, there was a negative correlation between individual maximal sailing HR expressed as a percentage of HR reserve and the second ventilatory threshold expressed as a percentage of VO 2max . Billat and Koralsztein (1996) have reported that the second ventilatory threshold is a good indicator of aerobic power. One explanation for the observed negative correlation could be that subjects with lower thresholds have to make a greater relative effort than the fitter ones to generate similar work, resulting in a higher HR. In that case, it is possible that the fittest athletes were often sailing under or just at the level of their respective anaerobic threshold leading to a relatively moderate HR (De Vito et al. 1997). It is possible that the athletes with good aerobic power need only to make a relatively low effort during races against athletes with poorer fitness levels. The present results confirm that Olympic windsurfing is an endurance activity in which physiological variables have an important bearing on performance (De Vito et al. 1997). Indeed it has been reported that, depending on the part of the race, Olympic windsurfing can be compared to a <measure type="value" ptr="#ee1f5630-10b9-4af8-8e15-27a73ab6995a" pos="left">2000-m</measure> <quantifiedObject id="ee1f5630-10b9-4af8-8e15-27a73ab6995a">rowing event</quantifiedObject> (i.e. <measure type="interval">90-95%</measure> HR max for about <measure type="value" ptr="#469b1ec5-5d2f-4e78-837b-014ea6489db2" pos="right">6.5 min</measure>) for the downwind leg and to what has been defined as the ''efficient active recovery stage'' of cycling and swimming (<measure type="interval">75-80%</measure> HR max ) for the upwind leg (Gue´velGue´vel et al. 2000).</p>
	<p>To summarize, the present study showed that Olympic windsurfing performance depends upon the level of active involvement of each athlete during a race, indeed light and medium racing performances were correlated to the sailing HR, i.e. exercise intensity. These results reinforce the findings of former studies showing that from the moment ''pumping'' was allowed in international windsurfing events, racing intensity has increased. From <measure type="interval">5 to 16 knots</measure>, a windsurfer's performance is greatly dependent on their ability to maintain continuous pumping, resulting in high heart rates. Windsurfing athletes and coaches should consider these findings when planning their physical training programs.</p></text>
