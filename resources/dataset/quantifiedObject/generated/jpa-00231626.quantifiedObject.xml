Introduction. -Recent experiments on the propagation of longitudinal sound waves near the nematic-smectic A transition of liquid crystals have shown an isotropic anomalous increase in the attenuation [1,2] and an isotropic dip in the velocity [2].</p>
	<p>These terms in the free energy involve only the director, order parameter and velocity. We add to these terms involving the density which we call Fp. Thus, the free energy F is given by where we take for ~ [11,12] We have neglected fluctuations in the temperature in eq. (3) and the thermodynamic derivative which occurs in (3) with the <measure type="value" ptr="#dd4ba307-1de0-48c1-8daf-439d12ef66d7" pos="left">zero</measure> <quantifiedObject id="dd4ba307-1de0-48c1-8daf-439d12ef66d7">subscript</quantifiedObject> is the thermodynamic derivative evaluated in the absence of any coupling of the density to fluctuations in the order parameter, m. The last term in eq. (3) describes the coupling of the order parameter, m of ref. [6], and density [12].</p>
	<p>The formal solution for m from eq. (7) At frequencies less than r(q) (evaluated at a wave vector q corresponding to the density wave which appears in the ordered state), we may follow Kawasaki [8] and use the small wave vector form for the x(q) which appears in the integral in (18a) and (18b). This form is given in eq. (A. 2) of ref. [6] and is given by Further we assume that the pressure dependence of x(q) occurs in the a term in the expression for x(q), so that then substituting (20) and (11) [1]. (See also ref. [13].) Returning to eq. (18b), we may use the scaling laws of ref. [14] to evaluate the <measure type="value">zero</measure> frequency limit of v(co). We define the critical exponent z, which determines the rate of relaxation of the order parameter by where ~1 is the correlation length perpendicular to the director defined in ref. [14]. Then [2] is also explained qualitatively. Higher frequency sound waves will be affected less at the transition, as seen from eq. (25). This agrees with the experiment of ref. [2].</p></text>
