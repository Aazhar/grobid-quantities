	<p>The past decades have seen a great number of discoveries of planets around stars other than our Sun ( Schneider et al. 2011). As some of these planets are of terrestrial nature, the hope of identifying Earth analogs has lead to considerable advances toward the detection of possibly habitable worlds (Borucki 2011;Fordetal.2012). Even though quite frequent in the solar neighborhood (Kiseleva-Eggleton &amp; Eggleton 2001), not many attempts have yet been made to specifically target binary stars in this endeavor. Nonetheless, more than <measure type="value" ptr="#dec282fd-89e7-496b-b43c-880adab7c9f5">60</measure> <quantifiedObject id="dec282fd-89e7-496b-b43c-880adab7c9f5">planets</quantifiedObject> have already been found in and around such systems (Haghighipour 2010;Doyle et al. 2011;Welsh et al. 2012;Roell et al. 2012;O r o s z et al. 2012a, 2012bDumusque et al. 2012). Although several P-type (circumbinary) planets orbiting both stars of a close binary have also been discovered ( Doyle et al. 2011;W e l s h et al. 2012;Orosz et al. 2012aOrosz et al. , 2012b), most planets are in the so-called S-type ( Rabl &amp; Dvorak 1988) configuration where the planet orbits only one of the binary's stars. A prominent example of an S-type system is α Centauri AB which hosts a terrestrial planet around the fainter binary component, α Cen B ( Dumusque et al. 2012).</p>
	<p>Understanding the complex interactions between a stellar binary and a planet is essential if a system's potential habitability is to be evaluated. For instance, one of the main assumptions of classical habitability, as introduced by Kasting et al. (1993), is that the planet moves around its host star on a circular orbit. This may not be a valid assumption for planets in a binary star system where the gravitational perturbation of the secondary can excite the eccentricity of the planet's orbit (Marchal 1990;Georgakarakos 2002;Eggl et al. 2012). Eggl et al. (2012) found that except for S-type systems where the secondary star is much more luminous than the planet's host star, variations in planetary orbit around the planet-hosting star are the main cause for changes in insolation. Even though Eggl et al. (2012)g a v ea n analytic recipe for calculating the boundaries of the habitable zones (HZs) in S-type binaries, it remains to be seen whether an Earth-like planet in the HZ of a system with <measure type="value" ptr="#c6ed4030-f6b6-4cb9-aa03-0b380a13e81b">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c6ed4030-f6b6-4cb9-aa03-0b380a13e81b">Sun-like stars</quantifiedObject> will in fact be detectable.</p>
	<p>In order to answer this question, we consider <measure type="value" ptr="#deb3e6ab-1f0d-4b42-bb61-9995745fbe94">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="deb3e6ab-1f0d-4b42-bb61-9995745fbe94">techniques</quantifiedObject>, namely, radial velocity (RV), astrometry (AM), and transit photometry (TP), and discuss whether the current observational facilities are capable of detecting habitable planets in such systems. We provide analytical formula for estimating the strength of RV and AM signals for habitable, Earth-like planets, and show that the planet-binary interaction can enhance the chances for the detection of these objects.</p>
	<p>To estimate the RV signal that an Earth-like planet produces in an S-type binary system, we will build upon the formalism presented by Beaugée ta l . ( 2007). We assume that the nonplanetary contributions to the host star's RV signal (such as the RV variation caused by the motion of the binary around its center of gravity) are known and have been subtracted, leaving behind only the residual signal due to the planet. The motion of the planet around its host star then constitutes a perturbed <measure type="value">two</measure>-body problem, where the gravitational influence of the secondary star is still playing a role and is mirrored in the forced variations of the planet's orbit.</p>
	<p>Our goal in this section is to identify the range of the possible peak amplitudes that a terrestrial planet in an S-type binary configuration can produce. We note that the gravitational influence of the second star causes the planet's orbital elements to vary, thus inducing additional time-dependent changes in the RV signal V r (Lee &amp; Peale 2003). While we know from secular perturbation theory that a does not change significantly with Beaugé et al. 2007). The planet is at <measure type="value">1 AU</measure> with ω = <measure type="value">45 •</measure> when e 񮽙 = <measure type="value">0</measure>. Bottom: the amplitude variations of the primary's radial velocity signal due to an Earth-like planet that is subject to the gravitational perturbations of a second star. Both stars are Sun-like with <quantifiedObject id="200824ae-6779-4564-aa3b-0e8f0eebbe10">a separation of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#200824ae-6779-4564-aa3b-0e8f0eebbe10">20 AU</measure> and <quantifiedObject id="eb46893f-5b7a-413c-b916-04a5c4d48bbc">an orbital eccentricity of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#eb46893f-5b7a-413c-b916-04a5c4d48bbc">0.5</measure>.

Our analytically estimated maximum amplitude V max r is also shown. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.) time for hierarchical systems such as the one under consideration (Marchal 1990;Georgakarakos 2003), ω becomes a function of time. We assume coplanar orbits of the planet and the binary star which result in the planet's inclination to the plane of the sky (i) to remain constant. In contrast, the planetary eccentricity will vary between <measure type="value">zero</measure> and a maximum e max , where the latter value can be expressed as a function of the system's masses and the binary's orbital parameters ( Eggl et al. 2012). This is important, because the reflex RV signal (V r ) of a star can be increased significantly by planetary orbital eccentricities (Figure 1). Using Equation (1), we identify the global maximum of V r at f = ω = <measure type="value">0</measure>, when e = e max . This leads to</p>
	<p>Equation (3) presents a fully analytic estimate of the expected maximum RV signal that a terrestrial planet produces in an S-type binary configuration. 4 As an example for the influence of a double star on a planetary RV signal, the induced variations in the RV of the planet's host star are presented in the bottom panel of Figure 1. The host star is a constituent of a solar-type binary with <quantifiedObject id="815700c9-d1e8-4fd7-943f-0cea69a81b6a">a semimajor axis of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#815700c9-d1e8-4fd7-943f-0cea69a81b6a">20 AU</measure> and <quantifiedObject id="aa485dfe-618c-45c2-8598-db4b7e7f93c5">an orbital eccentricity of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#aa485dfe-618c-45c2-8598-db4b7e7f93c5">0.5</measure>. Changes in the amplitude of V r are due to variations in the planet's eccentricity.</p>
	<p>Since rms values are by convention time-averaged, we substitute f by the mean anomaly M = n p t in all corresponding functions using the equation of the center expansion up to the sixth order in planetary eccentricities (see Appendix A) and average over M and ω. The vastly different rates of change of these quantities ( ˙ M ≫˙ ω) make it possible to consider ω to remain constant during <measure type="value" ptr="#54a8ec4e-b30a-4f95-b368-ecf8971f2bff">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="54a8ec4e-b30a-4f95-b368-ecf8971f2bff">cycle of</quantifiedObject> M, so that independent averaging can be performed. In order to eliminate short-term variations in the RV signal, we first average over M. Averaging over ω as well might be desirable if for example the initial state of ω is unknown, or if observations stretch beyond secular evolution timescales of the planets argument of pericenter. We, therefore, define <measure type="value">two</measure> different types of rms evaluations for a square-integrable function F:</p>
	<p>Here we have considered 񮽙a񮽙 M = a since ˙ a ≃ <measure type="value">0</measure> (Marchal 1990; Georgakarakos 2003). Also</p>
	<p>as indicated in Appendix B. It is noteworthy that the averaging over ω causes the rms value of the RV signal to become independent of e so that its difference with the peak signal in the circular case (V circ r ) becomes a mere factor of <measure type="value">1/ √ 2</measure>. Thanks to their intricate relation to power spectra, rms values can also be valuable for orbit fitting. The choice of singly or doubly averaged rms relations for this purpose will depend on how many planetary orbital periods are available in the data set. In the case of α Cen Bb, there are order-of-magnitude differences in the rates of change of the mean anomaly ( ˙ M) and the argument of pericenter ( ˙ ω). It would therefore make more sense to assume ω to be constant and add it as a variable in the fitting process. If stronger perturbations or additional forces act on the planet, the periods can be considerably shorter, so that the fully averaged equations might come in handy.</p>
	<p>The right-hand side of Equation (14) is independent of Ω and has a global maximum at f = π, ω = <measure type="value" ptr="#9b0d15d6-bbb7-49f2-b101-24f8178fd72c">0</measure> <quantifiedObject id="9b0d15d6-bbb7-49f2-b101-24f8178fd72c">when e = e max</quantifiedObject> .This translates into a maximum astrometric amplitude given by</p>
	<p>The planetary maximum AM signal will again lie between ρ circ and ρ max . A remarkable feature of ρ max and ρ circ is their independence of the system's inclination i. This is visualized in Figure 2. The same figure also shows the time evolution of the AM signal due to an Earth-like planet orbiting α Cen B at <quantifiedObject id="8e9ce089-6c07-4ef1-860c-3a22da4565cb">a distance of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#8e9ce089-6c07-4ef1-860c-3a22da4565cb">1 AU</measure>.</p>

As shown here, the maximum distance from the origin of the coordinate system is independent of the system's inclination with respect to the plane of the sky (i). Bottom: evolution of the astrometric signal (x f ,y f ) caused by an Earth-like planet in a binary star system.

	<p>In this section, we will show that the previously derived analytic expressions produce results that are in good agreement with the current observations of α Cen Bb. We will also present numerical evidence that the presence-or the absence-of an additional terrestrial planet in the HZ of α Cen B cannot be derived easily from the orbit evolution of α Cen Bb. Consequently, we argue that an independent detection of additional Notes. Coplanarity of the system was assumed. The formal uncertainties have been derived assuming Gaussian error propagation of the uncertainties given in Table 1. The maximum predicted planetary eccentricity for α Cen Bb is e max = <measure type="value">0.003</measure>. When taking general relativity into account, however, the orbit of α Cen Bb will remain practically circular (see Figure 6). terrestrial companions might be difficult, but more promising. For this purpose, we will determine the HZ of α Cen B, as well as the RV, AM, and TP signatures of an Earth-like planet orbiting in the HZ of α Cen B. Since there is no a priori reason why the brighter component of α Centauri could not be hosting a terrestrial planet as well, we perform a similar analysis for α Cen A. We will also study the behavior of Equations (1)- (21) for a broad range of binary eccentricities.</p>
	<p>The planet discovered around α Cen B offers a perfect opportunity to compare the RV amplitude predictions derived in Section 2 with actual measurements. The planet's known orbital parameters are given in Table 1. In Table 2, we present the analytic estimates of Section 2 applied to the α Centauri ABb system. Assuming the system to be coplanar (i ≃ <measure type="value">79. • 2</measure>), the predicted RV amplitude for circular planetary motion (V circ r )is very close to the observed RV amplitude. This is not surprising, since the planetary parameters were derived from an RV signal using the same methodology in reverse. While still well within measurement uncertainties, the deviation of the maximum RV amplitude (V max r ) from the observed value is larger than that of V circ r . On the one hand, this might indicate that the planet is currently in an orbital evolution phase where its eccentricity is almost <measure type="value">zero</measure>. On the other hand, the planet may be too close to its host star for our model to predict V max r correctly. In fact, we show in Section 5.3 that the latter explanation is more likely, since the influence of general relativity (GR) cannot be neglected in this case. Estimates based on Newtonian physics exaggerate the actual eccentricity of α Cen Bb. Its orbit remains practically circular despite the interaction with the binary star (see Section 5.3 for a detailed discussion). This justifies the assumption of a circular planetary orbit made by Dumusque et al. (2012).</p>
	<p>Combining the classical definition of an HZ ( Kasting et al. 1993) with the dynamical properties of a planet-hosting double reacts strongly to enhanced binary eccentricities (top row, curved, solid lines) whereas in contrast, 񮽙񮽙V r 񮽙񮽙 M,ω is independent of the binary's eccentricity (bottom row, straight, vertical lines). The straight, vertical lines in the top row correspond to RV amplitudes for circular orbits (V circ r ). See Section 5.4 for details. star system, Eggl et al. (2012) have shown that one can distinguish <measure type="value" ptr="#6f8dbd80-e610-4d30-8f5c-88dae324160d">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="6f8dbd80-e610-4d30-8f5c-88dae324160d">types of</quantifiedObject> HZ in an S-type binary system.</p>
	<p>The permanently habitable zone (PHZ) where a planet always stays within the insolation limits (S I , S O ) as defined by Kasting et al. (1993) and Underwood et al. (2003). In other words, despite the changes in its orbit, the planet never leaves the classical HZ. The total insolation the planet receives will vary between the inner (S I ) and outer (S O ) effective radiation limits as S I S tot S O where, for a given stellar spectral type, S I and S O are in units of solar constant (<measure type="value">1360 W m −2</measure> ). The extended habitable zone (EHZ) where, in contrast to the PHZ, parts of the planetary orbit may lie outside the HZ due to the planet's high eccentricity, for instance. Yet, the binary-planet configuration is still considered to be habitable when most of the planet's orbit remains inside the boundaries of the HZ. In this case, 񮽙S tot 񮽙 t + σ S I and 񮽙S tot 񮽙 t − σ S O where 񮽙S tot 񮽙 t denotes the time-averaged effective insolation from both stars and σ 2 is the effective insolation variance. The averaged habitable zone (AHZ). Following the argument of Williams &amp; Pollard (2002) that planetary eccentricities up to e&lt;<measure type="interval">0.7</measure> may not be prohibitive for habitability as long as the atmosphere can act as a buffer, the AHZ is defined as encompassing all configurations which support the planet's time-averaged effective insolation to be within the limits of the classical HZ. Therefore,</p>
	<p>Analytic expressions for the maximum insolation, the average insolation (񮽙S tot 񮽙), and insolation variance that a planet encounters in a binary system have been derived in Eggl et al. (2012). We refer the reader to that article for more details. Figures 3 and 4 show the application of the proposed habitability classification scheme to the α Centauri system. In these figures, blue denotes PHZs, green shows EHZs, and yellow corresponds to AHZs. The red areas in Figures 3 and 4 are uninhabitable, and purple stands for dynamically unstable regions. Table 1 shows the physical properties of the system. We used the formulae by Underwood et al. (2003) to calculate S I and S O for the given effective temperatures of α Cen A and B. In general, these formulae allow for extending the analytic estimates for HZs, as given by Eggl et al. (2012), to main-sequence stars with different spectral types. Runaway greenhouse and maximum greenhouse insolation limits were used to determine the inner and outer boundaries of HZs, respectively. In the bottom panels, the vertical lines represent areas of equal rms amplitudes, 񮽙񮽙ρ񮽙񮽙 M,ω . One can see that planetary orbits with dynamically enhanced eccentricities can have smaller semimajor axes and still produce similarly high astrometric amplitudes as circular orbits which are more distant from the host star. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the locations of the HZs and the detectability of habitable planets in those regions depend strongly on the eccentricity of the binary (e b ). The actual eccentricity of the α Centauri system is denoted by <quantifiedObject id="5baa68f6-151e-4bbe-a2b7-d078607eddd4">a horizontal line at</quantifiedObject> e b = <measure type="value" ptr="#5baa68f6-151e-4bbe-a2b7-d078607eddd4">0.5179</measure>. The values for the borders of the different HZs using α Centauri's actual eccentricity are listed in Table 3. As shown here, both stars permit dynamical stability for habitable, Earth-like planets. Due to the difference in stellar luminosities, the HZs around α Cen A are larger and farther away from the host star compared to α Cen B. Since the binary's mass ratio is close to <measure type="value">0.45</measure>, the gravitational influence of α Cen B is more pronounced on the PHZ of α Cen A. This is a consequence of the larger injected planetary eccentricities (e p ) as can be seen from the top row of Figure 5. The relatively larger gravitational influence of α Cen B onto the HZ of α Cen A is also mirrored in the fact that the region of dynamical instability (meshed, purple online) reaches toward lower binary eccentricities. The change in the range and configuration of HZs with the change in planetary semimajor axis and eccentricity of the binary is pronounced. A clear shrinking trend for PHZ and EHZ can be observed for high values of the binary's eccentricity. While as shown by Eggl et al. (2012), the AHZ in general expands slightly when the eccentricity is enhanced, Figures 3 and 4 show that in the α Centauri system, this HZ depends only weakly on e b , making it the closest approximation to the classical HZ as defined by Kasting et al. (1993). Comparing these results with the existing studies on the HZs for α Cen B such as Guedes et al. (2008) and Forgan (2012), one can see that the values of the inner boundaries of the HZs around α Cen B as given in Figures 3 and 4 coincide well with the previous studies. Forgan (2012) even found a similar shrinking trend with higher planetary eccentricity. Yet, Forgan (2012) did not take the actual coupling between the planet's eccentricity and the binary's orbit into account. The limits for the outer boundaries of HZ in our model are different from the ones in Forgan (2012) since different climatic assumptions were made. In this work, we used insolation limits for atmospheric collapse assuming a maximum greenhouse atmosphere ( Kasting et al. 1993) whereas Forgan (2012) focused on emergence from snowball states.</p>
	<p>While the classification of HZs presented in the previous section is globally applicable to binary star systems, the analytic estimates to calculate their extent ( Eggl et al. 2012) are only strictly valid for <measure type="value" ptr="#678c864f-ef5c-444e-afe1-ff71e2fe17ee">three</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="678c864f-ef5c-444e-afe1-ff71e2fe17ee">body systems</quantifiedObject>, e.g., the binary star and a planet. Additional perturbers will influence the shape and size of the HZs. It is thus necessary to investigate which effect the already discovered planet around α C e nBw o u l dh a v eo na n additional terrestrial planet in α Cen B's HZ.</p>
	<p>In Figure 6, results of numerical investigations on the coupled orbital evolution of an additional terrestrial planet and α Cen Bb are presented. The top row of Figure 6 shows the eccentricity evolution of α Cen Bb altered by an additional Earth-like planet at the inner and outer edge of α Cen B's AHZ. Figure 6. Additional terrestrial planet in α Cen B's HZ affects the orbit of α Cen Bb (top row) and vice versa (bottom row).

In one scenario, an additional Earth-sized body orbits α Cen B at the inner edge of its AHZ (see Table 3).</p>
	<p>In the other scenario, the terrestrial planet is assumed to be at the outer edge of α Cen B's AHZ. The analytic estimate for <quantifiedObject id="116c1ef2-081f-4025-b156-8bf19a10978c">the maximum eccentricity</quantifiedObject> (e max )i nt h e <measure type="value" ptr="#116c1ef2-081f-4025-b156-8bf19a10978c">3</measure>BP is presented as well (horizontal line). The top right panel shows the exact same setup, only with general relativity (GR) taken into account. The orbit of α Cen Bb becomes practically circular. While the influence of an additional planet at the outer edge of the HZ is barely noticeable in the eccentricity evolution of α Cen Bb, a planet at the inner edge of the AHZ would cause distinct features. In contrast, neither GR nor α Cen Bb will influence the eccentricity evolution of planets (e p )in the HZ significantly as is shown in the bottom left panel. Also, the semimajor axes evolution of additional planets in the HZ is negligible (bottom right panel). Here, Δa p /a p denotes the normalized difference between the <measure type="value">4</measure>BP+GR and the <measure type="value">3</measure>BP semimajor axis evolution of planets at the inner and outer edges of α Cen B's AHZ, respectively.</p>

The top left panel of Figure 6 shows the results in Newtonian <measure type="value">three</measure> (<measure type="value">3</measure>BP) and <measure type="value">four</measure> (<measure type="value">4</measure>BP) body problems. The top right panel depicts similar analysis with GR 7 included.

Thus, the orbit of α Cen Bb stays circular, even when tidal forces are neglected. The variations in semimajor axis (Δa)forα Cen Bb are not shown, because they remain below <measure type="interval" ptr="#ffe81bfc-70e3-4383-9dd6-7c4493be20ed">10 −8 AU</measure> for all cases. 7 GR was introduced by numerically solving the Einstein Infeld Hoffman equations ( Einstein et al. 1938) for the respective systems.</p>
	<p>In order to confirm that the interaction between α Cen Bb and Earth-like planets in the HZ is small, as well as to further study the influence of the GR on the dynamics of the system, we examined the orbital evolution of a fictitious habitable planet in that region. The results are shown in the bottom row of Figure 6. The left panel depicts the eccentricity evolution of additional terrestrial planets positioned at the inner and outer edges of α Cen B's AHZ. The secular variations in the eccentricity (bottom left panel) and semimajor axis (bottom right panel) of the habitable planet were computed numerically, taking the influence of the binary α Cen AB, the planet α Cen Bb, as well as GR into account. When comparing the analytic estimates of e max with the evolution of the habitable planet's eccentricity in the full system, it is evident that neither GR nor α CenBbalter the results for planets in α Cen B's HZ significantly. Also, the deviation in the habitable planet's semimajor axis due to GR and α CenBb(Δa p ) remains below <measure type="interval">0.1%</measure> and <measure type="interval" ptr="#b523bbe8-45de-4c4a-9f19-1502e5248557">0.5%</measure> for planets at the inner and outer edge of α Cen B's AHZ, respectively.</p>
	<p>We apply our methodology, as derived in Sections 2 and 3, to a fictitious terrestrial planet in the HZ of binary systems similar to α Centauri AB but with a broadened range of binary eccentricities. In addition to the habitability maps discussed in Section 5.2, Figures 3 and 4 show the results regarding the peak and rms strength of the RV and astrometric signals. Here, the aim is to illustrate how the different types of HZs presented in Section 5.2, as well as the maximum and rms signal strengths defined in Section 2 vary with the binary's eccentricity (e b ) and planetary semimajor axis (a p ). The left column of almost coincide. The same holds true for ρ max and ρ circ in this case. Yet, V max r and ρ max grow with the binary's eccentricity. The corresponding contour lines indicate that for high binary eccentricities even small planetary semimajor axes can produce similar AM peak signal strengths. Similarly, planets with larger distances to their host stars can still cause similar RV amplitudes if the binary's eccentricity is sufficiently large. If a fixed detection limit is set, e.g., V r = <measure type="value">9.5m/s</measure>, planets with semimajor axes up to <measure type="interval">1.5A U</measure> could still be found around stars similar to α Cen A, assuming a binary eccentricity of e b = <measure type="value">0.7</measure>. To produce a similarly high RV amplitude, a circular planet has to orbit its host star at roughly <measure type="value">0.8 AU</measure> (Figure 3). In other words, high binary eccentricities lead to excited planetary eccentricities which in turn increase the peak signal strengths suggesting that binary-planet interactions can actually improve the chances for detecting terrestrial planets. Naturally, if the planet's eccentricity happens to be close to <measure type="value" ptr="#96369f31-456c-405f-8f11-d77ac3ac1f85">zero</measure> at the time of observation, this advantage is nullified.</p>
	<p>The bottom row of Figures 3 and 4 show the same setup with rms signal strengths 񮽙񮽙V r 񮽙񮽙 M,ω and 񮽙񮽙ρ񮽙񮽙 M,ω , respectively. While 񮽙񮽙V r 񮽙񮽙 M,ω is independent of t<quantifiedObject id="55f30e37-0993-4b88-b39b-db76cadd3a9a">he binary</quantifiedObject>'s eccentricity, it is evident from Equation (17) that 񮽙񮽙ρ񮽙񮽙 M,ω depends weakly on e b since 񮽙e 2 p 񮽙 1/2 ≃ <measure type="value" ptr="#55f30e37-0993-4b88-b39b-db76cadd3a9a">0.1</measure> for the cases considered and therefore 񮽙e 2 p 񮽙≪1 (see Figure 5, bottom). The slight curvature of the contour lines representing the rms signal in Figure 4 indicates this behavior. A summary of RV and AM signal strengths for an Earth-like planet at the boundaries of α Centauri's HZ is presented in Table 3.</p>
	<p>To assess the detectability of a terrestrial planet in the HZ of α Centauri AB (and similar binar<quantifiedObject id="749482f7-8534-4aa3-8253-6b489b1d7549">ies) th</quantifiedObject>rough TP, we calculated the relative transit depths that an Earth-like planet would produce during its transit. If such a system hosted a transiting terrestrial planet, TD values would range around <measure type="value" ptr="#749482f7-8534-4aa3-8253-6b489b1d7549">55 ppm</measure> for α Cen A, and <measure type="value" ptr="#1b0da360-4124-42a5-a735-275e50046346">115 ppm</measure> for α Cen B. Such transit depths are detectable by NASA's Kepler telescope for instance-stellar and instrumental sources included-as the spacecraft's median noise level amounts to ≈<measure type="value">29 ppm</measure> ( Gilliland et al. 2011). Therefore, Earth-like planets could in theory be found around α Centauri stars. However, Kepler was not designed to observe stars with apparent magnitudes between <measure type="interval" ptr="#854a9415-15e0-4e35-956e-115439bc5149">0 and 3</measure> such as those of <quantifiedObject id="854a9415-15e0-4e35-956e-115439bc5149">α Centauri</quantifiedObject>. The Transiting Exoplanets Survey Satellite mission, for instance, will aim for TP of brighter stars ( Ricker et al. 2010). Nevertheless, the example of Kepler suggests that the detection of transiting habitable planets in S-type systems would be possible using current technology. In fact, very much similar to the cases discussed in the previous section, the orbit forcing that an Earth-like planet experiences in a binary star system may enhance its possibility of detection via TP (Kane &amp; von Braun 2008;Kane et al. 2012;Borkovits et al. 2003;Schneider 1994; also see Figure 7). Assuming α Centauri was a transiting system, 8 a comparison of the transit Graphs of the ratio of transit probabilities (p T /p Tc ) with p T ≡ p <quantifiedObject id="eaa05745-87e6-49bd-9e13-b212a3192c08">T | e=e max and</quantifiedObject> p Tc ≡ p T | e=<measure type="value" ptr="#eaa05745-87e6-49bd-9e13-b212a3192c08">0</measure> , in a binary similar to the α Centauri system. The graphs show the transit probabilities in terms of the planet's argument of pericenter ( ¯ ω), as measured from the line of sight for component A (top) and component B (bottom). The curved full lines correspond to the planet starting at the inner border of AHZ and dashed-curved line represents planets that started at the outer edge, for each star (see Table 3). The full and dashed straight lines are the corresponding ratios of the averaged transit probabilities (񮽙p T 񮽙/񮽙p Tc 񮽙) evaluated using Equation (21). Compared to the transit probability ratios p T /p Tc , the ratio of averages 񮽙p T 񮽙/񮽙p Tc 񮽙 shows only a weak dependence on the planet's initial position in the HZ. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.) probabilities of actual planetary orbits to circular orbits shows that an <measure type="value">18%</measure> increase in p T values seems possible for terrestrial planets at the outer edge of α Cen A's AHZ (Figure 7). Given the right orbital configuration, it may be more likely to identify a transiting habitable terrestrial planet around a stellar component of a binary than around a single star assuming similar initial planetary eccentricities.</p>
	<p>The increase in transit probability for planets in double star systems is less dramatic when the equations are averaged over all possible configurations of the argument of pericenter as in Equation (21). Averaged transit probabilities are represented by the straight lines in Figure 7.A <quantifiedObject id="91fd0c46-7e1c-430a-ba22-12829ad5c524">s񮽙p T</quantifiedObject> 񮽙/񮽙p T | e=<measure type="value" ptr="#91fd0c46-7e1c-430a-ba22-12829ad5c524">0</measure> 񮽙 &gt; <measure type="interval" ptr="#0b01cd5d-cc5e-4d98-9c1f-2cd44c1c2c73">1</measure>, for terrestrial planets' orbits with <quantifiedObject id="16a95d43-890f-4161-adbf-2f9bb5af33bc">e</quantifiedObject>&gt;<measure type="interval" ptr="#16a95d43-890f-4161-adbf-2f9bb5af33bc">0</measure>, the chance for transit is in general higher for Earth-like planets in binary stars than for terrestrial planets in circular orbits around single stars.</p>
	<p>Our prediction of RV amplitudes for terrestrial planets around α Cen B are also in good agreement with those presented by Guedes et al. (2008). The <measure type="value">four</measure> terrestrial planets used in the RV model by these authors produce almost exactly <measure type="value" ptr="#bba1392d-24ec-46bf-bada-7eebc5422d03">four</measure> times the predicted <quantifiedObject id="bba1392d-24ec-46bf-bada-7eebc5422d03">rms amplitude given</quantifiedObject> in Figure 3. Guedes et al. (2008) claim that Earth-like planets in the α Centauri are detectable even for signal-to-<quantifiedObject id="e61ad2be-1ef6-4546-b124-b024305571c9">noise ratios of</quantifiedObject> single observations below <measure type="interval" ptr="#e61ad2be-1ef6-4546-b124-b024305571c9">0.1</measure>. However, obtaining sufficient data to reconstruct the planetary signal requires a great amount of dedicated observing time (approximately <measure type="value" ptr="#32a895d7-3c95-4825-8a20-4c989fa16e6f">five years</measure> in their example). Validating this statement, it took Dumusque et al. (2012) about <measure type="value">four years</measure> of acquired data to detect α Cen Bb. The data published by Dumusque et al. (2012) also allow a glimpse on the current performance of the HARPS spectrograph revealing a precision around <measure type="interval">50-80 cm s −1</measure> . Given <quantifiedObject id="508b4b00-d7cb-44f3-954f-07ee2dcefd36">the fact</quantifiedObject> that the RV signal of a habitable planet around α Cen B would be still <measure type="value" ptr="#508b4b00-d7cb-44f3-954f-07ee2dcefd36">half</measure> an order of magnitude smaller (Figure 3), considerably more observation time would be required to identify habitable companions. HIRES measurements are currently yielding precisions around <measure type="value">1ms −1</measure> . Identifying RV signals of habitable worlds around α Cen B therefore seems even more unlikely when using HIRES. The previous examples show that some development of observational capacities is still necessary to achieve the RV resolution required for discovering habitable planets in the α Centauri system.</p>
	<p>We estimated the maximum and rms values of the RV as well as AM signal for a terrestrial planet in the α Centauri HZs. The peak and rms amplitudes of the RV signal ranged between <measure type="interval">4 and 12 cm s −1</measure> . Astrometric signals were estimated to lie between <measure type="interval">1 and 5 μas</measure>. Given the current observational facilities, enormous amounts of observing time would be required to achieve such precisions. If the α Centauri was a transiting system, however, a habitable planet could be detectable using current technologies. It seems that the detection of Earth-like planets in circumstellar HZs of binaries with Sun-like components via astrometry and RV is still somewhat beyond our grasp, leaving photometry to be the only current option in this respect.</p></text>
