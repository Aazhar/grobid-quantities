	<p>We have chosen to study furosemide-midazolam incompatibility, because these drugs are widely used in anesthesia and intensive care units. This incompatibility is due to an acid-base reaction. In an equivolume (<measure type="value" ptr="#24fd6f9e-fd47-4556-92fc-16ff3aea79c9" pos="left">1:1</measure>) <quantifiedObject id="24fd6f9e-fd47-4556-92fc-16ff3aea79c9">mixture</quantifiedObject>, the formation of a visible milky-white precipitate is immediate [8]. Because furosemide-midazolam incompatibility is pH-dependent, the impact of furosemide concentration is predictable. Furosemide in <measure type="value">10 mg/mL</measure> of saline is an alkaline solution (pH = <measure type="value">8.77</measure>). Mixing a furosemide solution with an acidic solution (i.e., <measure type="value" ptr="#2a4297dd-e433-4d02-9354-900d1eae4788" pos="left">5 mg/ mL</measure> <quantifiedObject id="2a4297dd-e433-4d02-9354-900d1eae4788">midazolam</quantifiedObject> = <measure type="value" ptr="#1ab991b3-8c10-4eba-afe4-00b0f3ee045f" pos="right">, pH3.47</measure>) decreases the pH of the mixture sufficiently to cause furosemide precipitation [9]. Furosemide and midazolam concentrations were simultaneously determined in the solution by UV spectrophotometry coupled with partial least square (PLS) regression [10].</p>

In the first, we revalidated the <measure type="value">two</measure> infusion conditions, following the same methods. In the second, for each infusion condition tested, we determined the mass flow rates of furosemide and midazolam on the infusion line with and without filter. <measure type="value" ptr="#669df701-2e3f-4e76-9720-9dbab6fe69cf" pos="left">Five</measure> <quantifiedObject id="669df701-2e3f-4e76-9720-9dbab6fe69cf">trials</quantifiedObject> were made per infusion condition tested. Drug concentrations in the mixture at the egress of the infusion line were determined using UV spectrophotometry (model UV-2450, Shimadzu, France) and partial least square (PLS) analysis. All information from the spectrophotometer was collected with UV Probe 2.21 software (Shimadzu, France). A partial least square (PLS) method on UV spectra was used to determine simultaneously the concentrations of the <measure type="value" ptr="#84f0e721-c7de-4074-82a6-0b4401740612" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="84f0e721-c7de-4074-82a6-0b4401740612">drugs</quantifiedObject> at the egress of the terminal extension line.</p>
	<p>PLS regression is a simple and powerful multivariate method based on factor analysis and is used for building regression models based on latent variable decomposition relating a block of independent variables, x (spectra), to a block of dependent ones, y (concentrations). PLS regression was obtained using the PLS module of XLSTAT software version 2011.2.01 (Addinsoft, France). The <measure type="interval" ptr="#f0cde545-add3-4977-bdc4-fb292fe9b7d9" pos="left">220-320 nm</measure> <quantifiedObject id="f0cde545-add3-4977-bdc4-fb292fe9b7d9">spectral zone</quantifiedObject> was used to obtain the best model.

Detection limits (LOD = 3.3 x standard deviation/gradient) of drugs in mixtures were <measure type="value">0.19 μg/mL</measure> for furosemide and <measure type="value" ptr="#ad4b595c-9419-41a0-96c3-6a1c05e26c89" pos="right">0.36 μg/mL</measure> for midazolam. The quantification limits (LOQ = 10 x standard deviation/ gradient) were <measure type="value">0.57 μg/mL</measure> for furosemide and <measure type="value" ptr="#fe7d1bb0-a626-45dd-9fce-6571fd9fe088" pos="right">1.10 μg/ mL</measure> for midazolam. Selectivity, calculated from the net analyte signal, was equal to <measure type="list">0.180.2</measure> and  for furosemide and midazolam respectively. Because these exceeded the spectrophotometer's linear range, they were diluted in saline. The drug mass flow rate (expressed as mg/h) was calculated as the product of drug concentration against total flow rate. Observed/theoretical mass flow rate ratios for each drug (%) also were determined per infusion condition. Measurements of pH were performed on drug solutions at the egress of infusion device using a pH meter (PHM201 MeterLab, Radiometer Analytical, Villeurbanne, France).</p>
	<p>The Student's t test was used to compare observed and theoretical drug mass flow rates and filtered and nonfiltered data after performing the Shapiro-Wilk test to check that the data observed was normally distributed. Results are expressed as mean values ± standard deviations (± SD) of mass flow rates. The level of significance was established at <measure type="value">0.05</measure>.</p>
	<p>The results are presented in Table 1. For the infusion condition that did not lead to the formation of visible particles, the number of subvisible particles was in accordance with the threshold defined by the European Pharmacopeia (<measure type="list">18.6</measure> and <measure type="value" ptr="#10c50156-8eaa-45eb-8d77-270f19becfe3" pos="right">0.4/mL</measure> for particles ≥ <measure type="interval" ptr="#460ecb88-9a11-42ae-9179-997229d02445" pos="left">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="460ecb88-9a11-42ae-9179-997229d02445">μm</quantifiedObject> and ≥ <measure type="interval" ptr="#a8c2bd83-fe4f-48fe-88e8-2464ce1e78b2" pos="left">25</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a8c2bd83-fe4f-48fe-88e8-2464ce1e78b2">μm</quantifiedObject>, respectively).</p>
	<p>Furthermore, for both drugs, the observed mass flow rates varied little with or without filter on the infusion set. For midazolam, observed mass flow rates were similar to theoretical values (<quantifiedObject id="fdb8573c-2a1a-485b-99fa-8934c8333236">ratios close</quantifiedObject> to <measure type="value" ptr="#fdb8573c-2a1a-485b-99fa-8934c8333236" pos="right">100 %</measure>) whatever the infusion conditions. For furosemide, however, observed mass flow rates were significantly different from theoretical values whatever the infusion conditions. The lowest furosemide mass flow rate value was found for the infusion condition leading to visible particles where a <measure type="value" ptr="#5e15adbe-2f05-40d1-84f5-e70c0836d314" pos="left">14 %</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5e15adbe-2f05-40d1-84f5-e70c0836d314">loss</quantifiedObject> was observed compared with theoretical values (ratios equal to <measure type="value">86 %</measure>). Even in the absence of visible particles, <quantifiedObject id="303b520c-a3ee-4fc5-9f25-a9408fa5d7e2">a furosemide loss of</quantifiedObject> approximately <measure type="interval" ptr="#303b520c-a3ee-4fc5-9f25-a9408fa5d7e2" pos="right">7-10 %</measure> compared with theoretical values was noted (<quantifiedObject id="c32011a6-e4b9-4df0-992b-0e50ca28662c">ratios equal</quantifiedObject> to <measure type="list" ptr="#c32011a6-e4b9-4df0-992b-0e50ca28662c" pos="right">90 %93</measure> and  % with filter and without filter, respectively). For both infusion conditions, the addition of a filter to the infusion set had no effect on the observed mass flow rates of the <measure type="value" ptr="#c5c49992-6149-4b28-bda0-d33b85b16748" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c5c49992-6149-4b28-bda0-d33b85b16748">drugs</quantifiedObject>.</p>
	<p>This study highlights the reduction in drug mass flow rates when physical incompatibility occurs between <measure type="value" ptr="#5160a2e8-d444-4bbc-905a-94cbd1cc6517" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5160a2e8-d444-4bbc-905a-94cbd1cc6517">drugs</quantifiedObject>. Preventing incompatibility is important if injectable drugs are to be safely administered. In "high-risk" cases where drug incompatibility is very probable, the use of a filter protects the patient against particle emboli. Nevertheless, the filter does not prevent drug loss in the case of precipitation. In this study, furosemide precipitation resulting in the formation of visible and/or subvisible particles led to a drug loss to the patient estimated at between <measure type="interval" ptr="#86a155e9-15be-4ccb-b175-19d77fa71f43" pos="left">10 15 %</measure> <quantifiedObject id="86a155e9-15be-4ccb-b175-19d77fa71f43">% and</quantifiedObject>. This was not caused by interaction with the filter, because similar results were obtained with or without filter. Furosemide was more impacted by the interaction of the <measure type="value" ptr="#84fa0994-72fe-476b-b8ff-9832b3f51524" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="84fa0994-72fe-476b-b8ff-9832b3f51524">drugs</quantifiedObject> as the pH of the mixture is acid (Table 1), and furosemide in its acidic form is poorly soluble in an aqueous solution [12]. For a substance to be soluble in water, it must be in its ionized form, which is not the case here for furosemide [9]. The impact of mixing conditions (concentration and flow rates) on particle formation also must be taken into consideration as the pH levels of mixed solutions were similar at the end of the extension line. This reduction in drug delivery should not have any clinical impact in the case of furosemide. Nevertheless, this result raises the issue for other mixtures of acid (amiodarone, ciprofloxacin, dobutamine, midazolam, norepinephrine) and alkaline (acyclovir, furosemide, phenytoin) drug solutions that may lead to physical incompatibilities. The major consequence for the patient could be therapeutic failure, especially in the case of drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. It should be noted that there are several limitations to this study. Our assessment was limited to a <measure type="value" ptr="#ba70f32c-8fb0-4dd7-9774-b1aa3e15f29c" pos="left">two</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="ba70f32c-8fb0-4dd7-9774-b1aa3e15f29c">drug combination inducing</quantifiedObject> pH-dependent incompatibility.
