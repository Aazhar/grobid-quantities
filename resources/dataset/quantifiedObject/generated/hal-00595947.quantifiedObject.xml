<text xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper a different compromise solution is chosen. More precisely, it is assumed that the sailcraft attitude motion is purely passive with the exception of a finite number of reorientation maneuvers whose aim is to rotate the sail such as to set the thrust to <measure type="value">zero</measure> and generate suitable coasting arcs along the trajectory, see Figure 1. Each maneuver is nearly instantaneous, as the time interval necessary to complete the sail reorientation is negligible with respect to the characteristic mission time. Such a Modulated Radial Thrust (MRT)</p><p>It is shown that the corresponding control law consists in setting the thrust on as long as the sail moves away from the Sun, and setting it to <measure type="value">zero</measure> when the sailcraft approaches the Sun. As a special case of the above strategy, the escape problem for a propelled trajectory is investigated. It is well known that, for a solar sail subjected to a CRT, there exists a minimum value of lightness number β min below which the sail cannot attain an escape condition (McInnes, 2003). Using an optimal MRT strategy the escape condition can be obtained even if β is substantially less than β min . Moreover, some simple analytical relationships are found that link the number of trajectory arcs with the minimum necessary value of β, the total mission time, and the minimum perihelion distance.</p><p>where µ ⊙ is the Sun's gravitational parameter and r is the Sun-sailcraft distance.

This example allows one to investigate the impact of the starting orbit eccentricity and the perihelion distance on the mission performance. However, we explicitly maintain that a direct comparison with the previous example (escape from an Earth's parking orbit) is not possible, as the following results do not take into account the transfer time from Earth's to Mercury's orbit.</p><p>From Table 2, the optimal escape strategy requires a single maneuver (n = <measure type="value">1</measure>), otherwise the sail film would be exposed to a temperature greater than the limit temperature of <measure type="value" ptr="#ec93decb-a804-46ea-b21c-177d254ab3e7">513.15 K</measure>.

(39), and the total flight time is about <measure type="value">3.7 years</measure>. However, the corresponding maximum temperature is Θ max ≃ <measure type="value">591.5 K</measure> and the resulting trajectory is rather complex, as shown in Fig. 5. Note that, as a consequence of Eq. (15), for all of the conic arcs the semilatus rectum is constant and, accordingly, all the arcs intersect at <measure type="value" ptr="#2619be00-3565-441d-89f2-9ce657c7e62f">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="2619be00-3565-441d-89f2-9ce657c7e62f">points</quantifiedObject>. As previously pointed out, an increase of the number of trajectory arcs implies a decrease of both the minimum perihelion distance and the minimum characteristic acceleration required to attain an escape condition. Such a behavior is essentially due to the substantial increase of radial acceleration that a sailcraft experiences when it approaches the Sun. For comparative purposes, it is possible to calculate the performance of a CRT spacecraft with constant thrust using the mathematical model discussed in Quarta and Mengali (2009). It can be verified that, the total flight time being the same, the characteristic acceleration required by a solar sail is much smaller than that of a CRT spacecraft. For example, assuming a flight time of <measure type="value">3.7012 years</measure>, a CRT spacecraft requires a characteristic acceleration a c = <measure type="value">1.162 mm/s 2</measure> to reach an escape condition, against about <measure type="value" ptr="#4f5a081d-735b-4959-bc0a-50d87467e0e4">0.4 mm/s 2</measure> of a solar sail spacecraft, see Tab. 2.</p><p>As a second scenario, consider now a mission whose aim is to reach a final Keplerian orbit with a given (finite) value of semimajor axis a <quantifiedObject id="f4871fae-ef03-4436-813b-dc0fb0357064">f &gt;</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#f4871fae-ef03-4436-813b-dc0fb0357064">0</measure>, starting from a parking orbit with semimajor axis a 0 and eccentricity e 0 ∈ [<measure type="value">0</measure>, <measure type="value">1</measure>). The problem here is to find the minimum value of β required to accomplish such a mission. Recall from Eqs. (14) and (16) that the final orbit eccentricity is univocally obtained as a function of a f . Assume that the (final) n−th trajectory arc starts with a P-C maneuver and that the sailcraft, once reached the final orbit, jettisons the propulsion system.
