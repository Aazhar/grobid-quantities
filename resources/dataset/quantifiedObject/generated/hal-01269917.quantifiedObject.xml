Key points:  There is still controversy on generic substitution in general, and specifically for antiepileptic drugs.  We examined whether brand-to-generic antiepileptic drug substitution was associated with seizure-related hospitalization.  With a narrow confidence interval, our results allow exclusion of a relevant association between brand-to-generic substitution and seizure-related hospitalization, in well-controlled, seizure-free patients.  These findings may contribute to restoring confidence in generic antiepileptic drug formulations and more generally it might be reassuring for generic utilization, especially in stable patients with chronic disease.

Methods: To assess association between brand-to-generic (B-G) antiepileptic drug (AED) substitution and seizure-related hospitalization, we designed a case crossover using the French National Health Insurance Database. We identified a cohort of adult patients who filled a prescription in <measure type="value" ptr="#3238b4f1-0dc3-4c2d-a671-5565fd9e2723">2009</measure>-<measure type="interval" ptr="#2a324b21-c0a7-4d65-8f41-af70a66d0c5c">2011</measure> for AEDs with at least one brand name and <measure type="value" ptr="#043abb6b-b404-42ec-96b1-44f352ec0e54">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="043abb6b-b404-42ec-96b1-44f352ec0e54">generic form</quantifiedObject>.

We required individuals to have regular dispensations of AEDs within the year preceding the outcome date. Free patients were defined as patients who had only brand-name dispensations before the control period.

Conclusions: B-G AED substitution was not associated with an elevated risk of seizure-related hospitalization. 3</p>
	<p>Some studies argued for the association between generic substitution and a risk of breakthrough seizures: opinion studies among clinicians and patients 1,[8][9][10][11] , <quantifiedObject id="026ff7f7-5e10-41bf-9bfe-8a3408c1a868">observational cohort</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#026ff7f7-5e10-41bf-9bfe-8a3408c1a868">12</measure>-15 or case-control studies [16][17][18] . These studies present several methodological limits and most of them were sponsored by brand medication manufacturers. In contrast, studies argued for a lack of association between generic substitution and a risk of seizure: meta-analysis of clinical trials, but included few patients and were underpowered to detect true clinical differences 19 , observational cohort 20, 21 , case-control 22,23 and case-crossover studies 24,25 . The study of <quantifiedObject id="d55c3753-9f28-490f-85a1-d853eb6a78c4">Gagne</quantifiedObject> et al <measure type="value" ptr="#d55c3753-9f28-490f-85a1-d853eb6a78c4">23</measure> hypothesized that refilling a prescription for the same manufacturer's AED might itself be associated with risk of seizure-related events, due to confounders. The odds ratio (OR) was <measure type="value">2.75</measure> (<measure type="value">95%</measure> CI <measure type="interval">0.88-8.64</measure>) for refills that involved switching, yielding a refill-adjusted OR for <quantifiedObject id="f67d2f55-800b-41fa-9b73-7eb979514a50">switching of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#f67d2f55-800b-41fa-9b73-7eb979514a50">1.19</measure> (<measure type="value">95%</measure> CI <measure type="interval">0.35</measure>-3.99).</p>
	<p>We used a case-crossover design [26][27][28] . We arbitrarily chose a <measure type="value">3-day</measure> induction period and a <measure type="value" ptr="#d3d6cdbb-a0c3-4e0b-bb72-8d66a71936fb">3-month</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d3d6cdbb-a0c3-4e0b-bb72-8d66a71936fb">exposure window</quantifiedObject> (i.e. "case period") for primary analyses. The control period was then defined as the <measure type="value">3 months</measure> immediately preceding the case period in primary analyses.</p>
	<p>We used data from all adult patients affiliated to the French national health insurance scheme, aged <measure type="interval" ptr="#1460d543-baaa-4c20-a860-108835aa6400">18</measure> <quantifiedObject id="1460d543-baaa-4c20-a860-108835aa6400">years or more on</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval">January 2009</measure>, who had at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#9a3b43eb-0f6f-4fa7-9dd0-9618eb21ffac">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="9a3b43eb-0f6f-4fa7-9dd0-9618eb21ffac">reimbursement between</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#bdd3c6c8-d975-4ddb-b2ad-4938185f0853">2009 and 2011</measure> for <quantifiedObject id="bdd3c6c8-d975-4ddb-b2ad-4938185f0853">at least one</quantifiedObject> of the following AEDs: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate, or valproic acid, referred to as selected AEDs. These drugs had a brand name and at least one "A-rated" generic form available on the French market by this time (2009)(2010)(2011)) and were widely prescribed for epilepsy, allowing identification of epilepsy patients. They were extracted from the SNIIR-AM databases using anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification codes (N03AF01, N03AX09, N03AX14, N03AX11 or N03AG01).</p>
	<p>Cases were identified, using the PMSI database, as individuals with a seizure-related hospitalization between <measure type="interval" ptr="#bd1e6389-b311-42f6-9320-4f3b8f6386a7">January 2010</measure> and <quantifiedObject id="bd1e6389-b311-42f6-9320-4f3b8f6386a7">December 2011</quantifiedObject>. We used ICD-10 codes G40.x (epilepsy) or G41.x (status epilepticus) as codes of interest in primary or secondary hospital discharge diagnosis position. The index event date was defined as the date of occurrence in the PMSI database of one of the abovementioned codes of interest with an hospitalization-free (for ICD-10 G40.x or G41.x) period of at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#952acea8-1bb4-4d03-888d-624556216a2a">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="952acea8-1bb4-4d03-888d-624556216a2a">year</quantifiedObject> preceding the index event date (controlled epilepsy patients). We further required individuals to have regular dispensations of the same product for each targeted AED within the year preceding the index event date; this was defined as the dispensation of products having the same International Non-proprietary Name (INN) at the same strength per unit with the same number of units per box and the same dosage form. Regular dispensation (a proxy for medication adherence) was defined as at least <measure type="interval">ten</measure> dispensation claims within a year, keeping in mind that those dispensations are on a monthly basis in France. Thus, we excluded events that occurred in <measure type="interval">2009</measure> to ensure that exposure and hospitalization data were available for the <measure type="value">365 days</measure> prior to the index date for each case.</p>
	<p>Due to the late availability on the French market of levetiracetam generic form (August, 2011), we excluded patients who switched before the index date from the levetiracetam brand to the generic. Substitution was then classified into <measure type="value" ptr="#3a4b39bc-3303-446d-a39c-ebafe9360121">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="3a4b39bc-3303-446d-a39c-ebafe9360121">groups</quantifiedObject>: narrow therapeutic index (carbamazepine and valproic acid) or not (lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate). AED-free patients were defined as patients who had only targeted AED brand name dispensations before the control period; which means no prior exposure to AED generics before the control period. Conversely, patients who had at least one dispensation of the generic drug before control period were defined as AED non-free patients.</p>
	<p>Strict monotherapy was defined as dispensations of only <measure type="value" ptr="#548a8782-06c6-44b1-bbde-75b6c201c42c">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="548a8782-06c6-44b1-bbde-75b6c201c42c">targeted AED</quantifiedObject> and without any concurrent use of other AEDs during the year preceding the index event date. These other (non-targeted) AEDs were as follows: barbiturates, benzodiazepines (clonazepam, clobazam, diazepam), phenytoin, GABA analogs (gabapentin, pregabalin). No generic formulation of these drugs was available in the French market (e.g. phenytoin) or they were not specifically dedicated to epilepsy treatment (e.g. gabapentin). They were identified by their CIP number.</p>
	<p>Data were analyzed using standard methods for matched case-crossover data. Odds ratios (ORs) and <measure type="value">95%</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b3a9c4f7-96d2-41d3-b929-58b18612dd40">confidence intervals</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#b3a9c4f7-96d2-41d3-b929-58b18612dd40">95%</measure> CIs) for seizure-related hospitalizations were estimated using conditional logistic regression models.</p>
	<p>We introduced an interaction term between switch occurrence and user profile (AEDfree patient or not), strict monotherapy or not, age strata, or gender. Age strata were defined according to first and third quartiles. Statistical models were first built without any adjustment and then with adjustment for non-seizure-related hospitalizations during case and control periods. All analyses were conducted using the SAS statistical package (<quantifiedObject id="adc0c364-ba81-4d9f-b62f-e5425075ffa3">version</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#adc0c364-ba81-4d9f-b62f-e5425075ffa3">9.3</measure>; SAS Institute, Cary, N.C., USA).</p>
	<p>We reduced case and control periods to <measure type="interval">28 days</measure> and we tested <measure type="value">1-day</measure> and 5-day induction periods. Analyses were also performed for B-G substitution of any targeted AEDs or narrow therapeutic index AEDs (carbamazepine and valproic acid).</p>

When we considered a non-seizure-related hospitalization as an exposure, the OR (<measure type="value">95%</measure>CI) was <measure type="list">1.30</measure> (<measure type="interval">1.18-1.44</measure>), p &lt; <measure type="interval">0.0001</measure>. Controlling for this covariate made no material difference to the effect estimates for B-G AED substitution (Table 4).</p>
	<p>Based on the largest set of data to date, our findings support the absence of association between brand-to-generic antiepileptic drug substitution and the risk of seizure-related hospitalization for AEDs with or without a narrow therapeutic index in the target population for clinicians (i.e. seizure-free patients, controlled by a stable treatment). This result supports that the bioequivalence between generics and their branded counterparts means clinical equivalence and is consistent with the bioequivalence requirements established by the Food and Drug Administration (identical to those of the European Medicines Agency) which are intended to ensure that differences in bioavailability between generics and their brand-name counterparts are not greater than between-lot variations from <quantifiedObject id="e11fb125-5ff3-4f2c-b3f2-1a9fe99c9814">a single manufacturer</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#e11fb125-5ff3-4f2c-b3f2-1a9fe99c9814">23</measure>,29 .</p>
	<p>By seeking an association in patients receiving stable therapy who had been seizurefree for at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#6e83b9a3-7e0f-46d8-8fee-dc2fa8a4e7e3">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="6e83b9a3-7e0f-46d8-8fee-dc2fa8a4e7e3">year</quantifiedObject>, this provides the best possible conditions to assess the impact of substitution on the clinical state of patients. Patients for whom loss of seizure control has the most serious medical and social consequences (e.g. injury, loss of driving license, loss of employment…) are stable patients. In our study, the eligibility of seizure-free patients is warranted by the absence of any G40/G41 ICD-10 codes within the year preceding the index date and by continuous brand or generic use, resulting in only adherent patients being captured. Indeed, non adherence has been shown to be associated with increased seizure risk and a significantly higher incidence of hospitalization 20 . Furthermore, the number of AEDs dispensed is a strong predictor of seizure-related events 24 and multiple AEDs are generally reserved for patients with more severe forms of epilepsy, thus making multiple AEDs a potential proxy for disease severity 22 . Yet at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#a0d3e81f-6d60-418f-8097-d5e30ec20346">40</measure><quantifiedObject id="a0d3e81f-6d60-418f-8097-d5e30ec20346">% of</quantifiedObject> patients in our study sample were on strict AED monotherapy, mainly valproic acid. In a previous study 30 , it was reported that AED monotherapy was the rule in stable epilepsy patients. The fact that the association remains non-significant in stable patients following strict monotherapy gives the result even more value.</p>
	<p>In the study of Zachry et al 16 , the percentage of patients experiencing a switch in the case group was highest in the <measure type="value" ptr="#048e549f-7d01-40c7-a94d-7bcd9e6f6ddb">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="048e549f-7d01-40c7-a94d-7bcd9e6f6ddb">months</quantifiedObject> prior to the index event (emergent epilepsy-related care) whereas this percentage in the control group was highest only in the first month prior to the index event, with no discernible pattern thereafter. In our study, the switches were evenly distributed throughout the case and control periods and sensitivity analyses, by varying the duration of the case and control periods and the induction period, confirming the robustness of the results.</p>
	<p>It is of note that the analysis based on the <measure type="value" ptr="#c6eb14fa-6f4e-4693-8882-8c2f659832d5">28-day</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c6eb14fa-6f4e-4693-8882-8c2f659832d5">case and</quantifiedObject> control period gave consistent results but a less precise estimation.</p>
	<p>We also have to consider ICD code accuracy and misclassification bias. However, these should be limited, given that most instances of seizures are readily <quantifiedObject id="dacbee73-6d42-4b68-b638-2dcfa89f11fc">evident for </quantifiedObject>healthcare providers. Other users of AEDs for conditions such as bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain or migraine may also have been included in our study population (i.e. <measure type="value" ptr="#dacbee73-6d42-4b68-b638-2dcfa89f11fc">24%</measure> of our patients have a previous psychiatric diagnosis). Nevertheless, AEDs indicated for diseases other than epilepsy were not selected, such as gabapentin.</p>
	<p>Moreover, studies have shown that the use of a combination of diagnosis codes and pharmacy claims of AEDs can correctly classify <measure type="value" ptr="#716b80ae-29d8-42a8-9085-3fdd6f42d36f">90%</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="716b80ae-29d8-42a8-9085-3fdd6f42d36f">epilepsy cases 31</quantifiedObject> and the most accurate algorithm to identify epilepsy cases in administrative health data is IDC-<measure type="interval" ptr="#ac562906-3f09-4887-a8bf-21102cc7de60">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="ac562906-3f09-4887-a8bf-21102cc7de60">codes G40/G41 32</quantifiedObject> .</p>
