Key points:  There is still controversy on generic substitution in general, and specifically for antiepileptic drugs.  We examined whether brand-to-generic antiepileptic drug substitution was associated with seizure-related hospitalization.  With a narrow confidence interval, our results allow exclusion of a relevant association between brand-to-generic substitution and seizure-related hospitalization, in well-controlled, seizure-free patients.  These findings may contribute to restoring confidence in generic antiepileptic drug formulations and more generally it might be reassuring for generic utilization, especially in stable patients with chronic disease.

Methods: To assess association between brand-to-generic (B-G) antiepileptic drug (AED) substitution and seizure-related hospitalization, we designed a case crossover using the French National Health Insurance Database. We identified a cohort of adult patients who filled a prescription in <measure type="value" ptr="#9f0b5419-33bd-4889-b5b2-0a411330ccc8">2009</measure>-<measure type="interval" ptr="#0cbe9adb-a5c9-4b43-9e52-decffa82763d">2011</measure> for AEDs with at least one brand name and <measure type="value" ptr="#a767c0b1-56d5-4965-bfcf-3bd4509c08e9">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a767c0b1-56d5-4965-bfcf-3bd4509c08e9">generic form</quantifiedObject>.

We required individuals to have regular dispensations of AEDs within the year preceding the outcome date.

Conclusions: B-G AED substitution was not associated with an elevated risk of seizure-related hospitalization. 3</p><p>Some studies argued for the association between generic substitution and a risk of breakthrough seizures: opinion studies among clinicians and patients 1,[8][9][10][11] , <quantifiedObject id="06384827-0253-4355-9bd7-4f7b1fe494bb">observational cohort</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#06384827-0253-4355-9bd7-4f7b1fe494bb">12</measure>-15 or case-control studies [16][17][18] . These studies present several methodological limits and most of them were sponsored by brand medication manufacturers. In contrast, studies argued for a lack of association between generic substitution and a risk of seizure: meta-analysis of clinical trials, but included few patients and were underpowered to detect true clinical differences 19 , observational cohort 20, 21 , case-control 22,23 and case-crossover studies 24,25 .

The odds ratio (OR) was <measure type="value">2.75</measure> (<measure type="value">95%</measure> CI <measure type="interval">0.88-8.64</measure>) for refills that involved switching, yielding a refill-adjusted OR for <quantifiedObject id="a13bf666-278b-4d66-93ec-68718b628134">switching of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#a13bf666-278b-4d66-93ec-68718b628134">1.19</measure> (<measure type="value">95%</measure> CI <measure type="interval">0.35</measure>-3.99).</p><p>We used a case-crossover design [26][27][28] .

These drugs had a brand name and at least one "A-rated" generic form available on the French market by this time (2009)(2010)(2011)) and were widely prescribed for epilepsy, allowing identification of epilepsy patients. They were extracted from the SNIIR-AM databases using anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification codes (N03AF01, N03AX09, N03AX14, N03AX11 or N03AG01).</p><p>Cases were identified, using the PMSI database, as individuals with a seizure-related hospitalization between <measure type="interval" ptr="#b6eb349c-5e39-4e01-a89a-1e7fc0c32152">January 2010</measure> and <quantifiedObject id="b6eb349c-5e39-4e01-a89a-1e7fc0c32152">December 2011</quantifiedObject>. We used ICD-10 codes G40.x (epilepsy) or G41.x (status epilepticus) as codes of interest in primary or secondary hospital discharge diagnosis position. The index event date was defined as the date of occurrence in the PMSI database of one of the abovementioned codes of interest with an hospitalization-free (for ICD-10 G40.x or G41.x) period of at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#2a7e3af8-3b37-4258-bb8b-ec329f4720e6">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="2a7e3af8-3b37-4258-bb8b-ec329f4720e6">year</quantifiedObject> preceding the index event date (controlled epilepsy patients). We further required individuals to have regular dispensations of the same product for each targeted AED within the year preceding the index event date; this was defined as the dispensation of products having the same International Non-proprietary Name (INN) at the same strength per unit with the same number of units per box and the same dosage form. Regular dispensation (a proxy for medication adherence) was defined as at least <measure type="interval">ten</measure> dispensation claims within a year, keeping in mind that those dispensations are on a monthly basis in France. Thus, we excluded events that occurred in <measure type="interval">2009</measure> to ensure that exposure and hospitalization data were available for the <measure type="value">365 days</measure> prior to the index date for each case.</p><p>Due to the late availability on the French market of levetiracetam generic form (August, 2011), we excluded patients who switched before the index date from the levetiracetam brand to the generic. Substitution was then classified into <measure type="value" ptr="#82605b86-aedf-4ff4-b33b-70972717800d">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="82605b86-aedf-4ff4-b33b-70972717800d">groups</quantifiedObject>: narrow therapeutic index (carbamazepine and valproic acid) or not (lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate). AED-free patients were defined as patients who had only targeted AED brand name dispensations before the control period; which means no prior exposure to AED generics before the control period. Conversely, patients who had at least one dispensation of the generic drug before control period were defined as AED non-free patients.</p><p>Strict monotherapy was defined as dispensations of only <measure type="value" ptr="#c46f673e-8586-4d66-8b61-9118d6ab1047">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c46f673e-8586-4d66-8b61-9118d6ab1047">targeted AED</quantifiedObject> and without any concurrent use of other AEDs during the year preceding the index event date. These other (non-targeted) AEDs were as follows: barbiturates, benzodiazepines (clonazepam, clobazam, diazepam), phenytoin, GABA analogs (gabapentin, pregabalin). No generic formulation of these drugs was available in the French market (e.g. phenytoin) or they were not specifically dedicated to epilepsy treatment (e.g. gabapentin). They were identified by their CIP number.</p><p>Data were analyzed using standard methods for matched case-crossover data.

Age strata were defined according to first and third quartiles. Statistical models were first built without any adjustment and then with adjustment for non-seizure-related hospitalizations during case and control periods.

This result supports that the bioequivalence between generics and their branded counterparts means clinical equivalence and is consistent with the bioequivalence requirements established by the Food and Drug Administration (identical to those of the European Medicines Agency) which are intended to ensure that differences in bioavailability between generics and their brand-name counterparts are not greater than between-lot variations from <quantifiedObject id="1f1b2703-067f-4a45-abe7-3d3c0e39b7ec">a single manufacturer</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#1f1b2703-067f-4a45-abe7-3d3c0e39b7ec">23</measure>,29 .</p><p>By seeking an association in patients receiving stable therapy who had been seizurefree for at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#963fc32e-198a-4902-9aef-f4a392b9f15c">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="963fc32e-198a-4902-9aef-f4a392b9f15c">year</quantifiedObject>, this provides the best possible conditions to assess the impact of substitution on the clinical state of patients. Patients for whom loss of seizure control has the most serious medical and social consequences (e.g. injury, loss of driving license, loss of employment…) are stable patients. In our study, the eligibility of seizure-free patients is warranted by the absence of any G40/G41 ICD-10 codes within the year preceding the index date and by continuous brand or generic use, resulting in only adherent patients being captured. Indeed, non adherence has been shown to be associated with increased seizure risk and a significantly higher incidence of hospitalization 20 . Furthermore, the number of AEDs dispensed is a strong predictor of seizure-related events 24 and multiple AEDs are generally reserved for patients with more severe forms of epilepsy, thus making multiple AEDs a potential proxy for disease severity 22 .
