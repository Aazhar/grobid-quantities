<text xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Tour de France is one the world"s largest sports events. The <measure type="value">three</measure>-week race attracts <measure type="interval">10 to 15 million</measure> (non-paying) spectators along the roads each year and individual stages are watched by <measure type="interval" ptr="#de77f8bc-8aab-40fd-bd0f-524b82f5a8c3">15</measure> to 20 million <quantifiedObject id="de77f8bc-8aab-40fd-bd0f-524b82f5a8c3">TV viewers</quantifiedObject> worldwide (see chapter 5). Although generally cycling races are not lucrative, the Tour de France organiser"s balance sheet reveals that the Tour has always been profitable in the past <measure type="value">two decades</measure>.</p><p>How can this attractiveness and the economic success story be explained? Most sports economists are used to turn to a contest"s outcome uncertainty as a first explanatory variable for success. However, fans of the Tour de France are not often surprised by the name of the final winner of the race, usually not even by the <measure type="value" ptr="#7ffac8ed-7c43-452a-861a-9e3e9cd7d947">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="7ffac8ed-7c43-452a-861a-9e3e9cd7d947">riders sharing</quantifiedObject> the podium. Nobody needs more than a few riders" names to predict with great certainty who the winner will be. Thus, explaining Tour de France success by outcome uncertainty and its usual metrics in terms of competitive balance must be checked carefully.</p><p>Tour de France attendance and TV audience do not seem to be seriously threatened and surely not definitely affected by recurring doping scandals either. This was neither the case after big doping issues many decades ago (for example when Tom Simpson died during the climb of the Mont Ventoux in 1967), nor in the past <measure type="value">twenty years</measure> (from the Festina affair in <measure type="value" ptr="#a4536754-463e-4550-a37d-432b6a05a47e">1998</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a4536754-463e-4550-a37d-432b6a05a47e">up to Lance</quantifiedObject> Armstrong being stripped from all his Tour de France wins in <measure type="value">2012</measure>). Although doping seems not to be an immediate threat to the popularity of the Tour de France, it is clear that doping detection and doping sanctions have not been efficient and effective enough so far to clean this sport contest from the use of forbidden doping substances and practices. This raises the issue of what could be a better way to combat the use of doping in the Tour de France or in cycling in general.</p><p>The chapter goes as follows. In the first section it is demonstrated how the Tour de France is a high quality product. This is a result from its accurate design, its management, its economic model and its finance structure, both in comparison to other mega-sporting events and with reference to tournament theory. It is not easy to assess the competitive balance in the Tour de France since, as was demonstrated in <quantifiedObject id="38bcd46e-58a8-42cc-8f15-9522f025e643">chapter</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#38bcd46e-58a8-42cc-8f15-9522f025e643">10</measure>, it is at the same time an individual and a team sport contest. After reviewing some results published in literature so far, a new metrics for evaluating competitive balanced in the Tour de France is presented in section 2. Finally, the Tour de France cannot ignore doping as a potential threat to fan attendance and TV viewing. We therefore discuss the issue of doping and a new procedure to deal with doping in section 3.</p><p>The Tour de France is managed by Amaury Sport Organisat<quantifiedObject id="1491161d-b789-49d5-9a63-22b3b7c854a9">ion (ASO). </quantifiedObject>ASO also organises other professional cycling races (such as Paris-Roubaix or the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré) as well as golf tournaments, track and field events, car races and horse-riding contests. Professional road cycling accounts for close to <measure type="value" ptr="#1491161d-b789-49d5-9a63-22b3b7c854a9">70%</measure> of ASO revenue, mainly because of the success of the Tour de France (Desbordes, 2006). Since ASO is a privately-owned company, it aims at profit maximising and designs its strategy accordingly. A first strategic tool consists in multiplying the number of trophies within a race. This process started up in <measure type="value" ptr="#7b4846d7-656b-4992-982b-0d51d564d727">1919</measure> with introducing the yellow jersey and lasted until 1989 when the number of trophies has nearly stabilised, respectively rewarding the best rider overall (yellow jersey), the best climber (polka-dot jersey), the best sprinter (green jersey), the best young rider (any rider aged below <measure type="interval">25</measure>, white jersey), and the best-ranked team. From time to time other trophies appeared and vanished again after some years. By creating "different races within the race", ASO attempted and succeeded in making the Tour de France a more vivid contest with multiple opportunities for duels between riders or teams competing for a given trophy and changes in the tactics adopted by riders or teams during the course of the race.</p><p>Two other factors that attract people to see riders on the Tour de France roads are linked together. The first one is the riders" performa<quantifiedObject id="9e7843c4-def6-4d15-a608-55feb9e2eb7d">nce, the s</quantifiedObject>econd one lies in the hardness of the race. Based on the number of racing days and the number of rest days per racing day, the Tour de France became much harder after the <measure type="value" ptr="#9e7843c4-def6-4d15-a608-55feb9e2eb7d">1920s</measure> with the number of racing days stabilising up to about <measure type="value">20 while one rest day per ten</measure> racing days became the usual ratio. Before the 1920s <quantifiedObject id="62808f98-54ee-4aeb-a7a0-ba576c00935f">the number of</quantifiedObject> stages was usually <measure type="value" ptr="#62808f98-54ee-4aeb-a7a0-ba576c00935f">15 at</measure> most and the riders enjoyed at least <measure type="value" ptr="#f79e0bf4-6346-4561-b308-044537e69a2f">one day</measure> of rest after each stage. The overall riding distance was <measure type="value">2,428 kilometers</measure> in <measure type="interval">1903</measure> and rose to a maximum of <measure type="value">5,745 kilometers</measure> in <measure type="value">1926</measure>. Since then the distance shortened to about 3,<measure type="value" ptr="#125c283c-7334-4857-8b4a-414b02312a0d">500 kilometers</measure> on average. Thus, compared with the initial era of so-called "road"s convicts" (les forçats de la route in French), riders now spend more days on the roads and have less often time to rest. However, this has been made feasible by reducing the average stage length from over <measure type="value">300 kilometers</measure> until <measure type="interval">1926 to less than 200 kilometers</measure> since the <measure type="value">1960s</measure>. Consequently, the average duration of a stage, i.e. the time actually spent by riders on their bikes, fell from <measure type="interval" ptr="#c4d27d6f-277d-469b-9cfd-52f554c8c51d">10 to 16 hours</measure> before the 1930s to slightly over <measure type="value">4 hours</measure> in the <measure type="value">2000s</measure>. The race also became harder due to the introduction of mountain stages. The first mountain ever climbed in the Tour de France was the Ballon d"Alsace in the Vosges region in <measure type="value">1905</measure>. A handful of years later, high-mountain stages in the Pyrenees (1910) and the Alps (1911) were introduced. However, the number of passes over <measure type="value" ptr="#59926c80-156f-404b-9ea3-2ac4088b4aa4">1,000 meters</measure> in a given Tour de France has not increased significantly on average since the 1920s.</p><p>Apart from the physical hardness of the Tour de France, it is also the increase in riders" performances that has made the Tour attractive to spectators. The overall average speed of the yellow jersey winner was between <measure type="interval">25 and 30 kilometers per hour</measure> (km/h) until the late 1930s. Since World War II it has steadily increased. From <measure type="value">25.7 km/h</measure> in <measure type="interval">1903</measure> to <measure type="value" ptr="#83a6f05d-bf8d-442c-87ec-fd1f1ca92a34">41.7 km/h</measure> in 2005 (the fastest Tour ever) is an improvement of <measure type="value">62%</measure>. Part of this acceleration is due to technical progress affecting riders" bikes such as the introduction of derailleur gears, the increase in the number of gears, lighter bikes, profiled wheels, etc. (Calvet, 1981;Andreff, 1985). Improvement of the road surface, shorter stages, multiple stakes and high effort intensity in the crucial parts of the race have also triggered both higher rider performance and increased attractiveness to spectators. Improved physical and medical preparation, better nutrition, and sometimes doping may have played a role as well. Another index of riders" performance is the withdrawal ratio, the percentage of riders who do not finish all stages of the Tour de France. This ratio decreased from over <measure type="value" ptr="#8dc716ab-e5df-49ee-846d-c95b1554ef78">70%</measure> in the <measure type="interval">1920s to 40%</measure> in the <measure type="value">1930s</measure> and about <measure type="value">20%</measure> during the <measure type="value">2000s</measure>. The highest withdrawal ratio was reached in <measure type="value">1926</measure> (as explained above the longest Tour de France ever held) with <measure type="value" ptr="#f71574d9-cb93-4803-932a-ba93058020e5">126</measure> <quantifiedObject id="f71574d9-cb93-4803-932a-ba93058020e5">withdrawals out</quantifiedObject> of <measure type="value" ptr="#51798483-2155-4f3a-a83e-3328d4ff8296">162</measure> <quantifiedObject id="51798483-2155-4f3a-a83e-3328d4ff8296">riders</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#160a207e-e9a7-4a5a-8e74-6af8224cce78">77.8%</measure>), meaning only <measure type="value" ptr="#4a0ff6ca-d11e-4d7b-8cd0-5c8c00d270a2">36</measure> <quantifiedObject id="4a0ff6ca-d11e-4d7b-8cd0-5c8c00d270a2">riders</quantifiedObject> finished the Tour de France that year. In 2009, the lowest withdrawal ratio was recorded with <measure type="value" ptr="#568e05f3-2c6a-480f-81f7-309890452ecd">156 out of 180</measure> <quantifiedObject id="568e05f3-2c6a-480f-81f7-309890452ecd">riders finishing</quantifiedObject> the Tour de France.

However, the demand for it is not infinite. The demand is rationed by various constraints such as the date and location of a stage or the hosting capacity of a geographical site (like the slopes of the Mont Ventoux or Alpe d"Huez), limiting the number of spectators. Nevertheless, from an economic point of view, a free sport event is likely to draw a huge attendance. Indeed, <measure type="interval" ptr="#2fdc5eb9-d33e-4037-a718-97c334c6ac18">10</measure> to 15 million <quantifiedObject id="2fdc5eb9-d33e-4037-a718-97c334c6ac18">spectators per</quantifiedObject> year attend the race over <quantifiedObject id="78b75172-5029-4043-828f-9289f7a24c8e">the course of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#78b75172-5029-4043-828f-9289f7a24c8e">three weeks</measure>. This is significantly more than the biggest mega-sporting event in the world, the FIFA World Cup with an attendance of <measure type="value" ptr="#c73dbec1-6c36-49a3-b633-f74fc5b8afcf">3,115,800</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c73dbec1-6c36-49a3-b633-f74fc5b8afcf">people</quantifiedObject> in Germany 2006 and <measure type="list" ptr="#9e6e4480-25cf-4dbd-bfd3-76609f0f6fb2">3</measure>,224,342 in South Africa 2010. Moreover, since all spectators cannot attend the Tour <measure type="value">21 days</measure> long, they also demand a story telling which was first supplied by newspapers, then through radio broadcasts and eventually through TV broadcasts.</p><p>The Tour de France has not always been a profitable business. Until the 1950s, financial deficits were common (Reed, 2010). The deficits vanished with rising TV rights revenues. The first Tour de France TV broadcast was the finish of the last stage at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris in <measure type="value">1948</measure> whereas the first TV broadcast of a mountain pass was at the Aubisque in <measure type="value">1958</measure>. Nowadays, the Tour is the major sports event in the French broadcasting market with well over <measure type="value" ptr="#090ebb20-d437-45fb-861b-68aa0cb8bacf">80 hours</measure> of broadcast, ahead of <quantifiedObject id="1d97b074-2e45-45e6-bfd6-331cf97da4de">the Roland Garros tennis tournament</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#1d97b074-2e45-45e6-bfd6-331cf97da4de">77 hours</measure>), Champions League matches, Formula 1 races and the rugby <measure type="value">Six</measure> nations tournament. In <measure type="value">2013, 24 million</measure> French people watched the Tour de France for at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#d783fc53-51ce-4002-812e-9a7f8917613f">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d783fc53-51ce-4002-812e-9a7f8917613f">hour</quantifiedObject> on French television, a TV market share of slightly over <measure type="value">30%</measure>. In chapter 5 it was explained how from the 1970s on the Tour de France was also broadcast in more and more countries.</p><p>Today it is <quantifiedObject id="c91b3936-794c-4782-bafb-514a899b8292">a global mega-sporting event. Over 100 TV channels in 190 countries now broadcast </quantifiedObject>the Tour de France, with live broadcast in <measure type="value" ptr="#145066ae-852a-44f9-a691-11d3a3e1616b">60</measure> <quantifiedObject id="145066ae-852a-44f9-a691-11d3a3e1616b">countries (www.aso.fr</quantifiedObject>). Consequently, the Tour de France TV rights revenues have increased significantly over the years. In 1960, the French public TV channel started paying TV rights for broadcasting the Tour de France. The French broadcasting rights equalled or the French professional football league broadcasting rights over <measure type="value" ptr="#7d5ec0ab-756c-453e-b86e-9918ab7aa4ce">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="7d5ec0ab-756c-453e-b86e-9918ab7aa4ce">season</quantifiedObject> (€ <measure type="value">668 million</measure>). No detailed information on the international TV deals is available, but in chapter 3 it was shown that the global broadcasting rights for the Tour de France probably amount to about € <measure type="value">50 million a year</measure>. As a result, the budget of the Tour de France has literally skyrocketed since the <measure type="interval">1980s1980</measure>. From  to the late 1990s, the Tour operational budget grew from € <measure type="value">5 million</measure> to € <measure type="value">50 million</measure> (Mignot, 2013) primarily due to the growth of TV rights revenues that multiplied by <measure type="value" ptr="#1f61ff3b-8119-44ee-ae12-2b46d50cb820">65</measure> over the same period of <quantifiedObject id="0376dd05-a810-420a-9ec4-8584d1ee9b5c">time (</quantifiedObject>from <measure type="value" ptr="#0376dd05-a810-420a-9ec4-8584d1ee9b5c">€ 250,000</measure> to € <measure type="value" ptr="#4a601e57-8000-4a8e-93e6-5f2a3307243d">16 million</measure>, the budget further increased from € <measure type="value">). In the past decade77 million in 2003</measure> up to € <measure type="value">130 million</measure> in 2013. Table 1 illustrates the financing sources of the Tour de France. Basically, <measure type="value" ptr="#382d3600-51f9-4e13-bd13-90d80418b340">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="382d3600-51f9-4e13-bd13-90d80418b340">types of</quantifiedObject> income can be distinguished: TV broadcasting rights, merchandising and sponsorship revenue, and income from municipalities. The media success story is the basis for the solid economic foundations of the Tour de France because it provided <measure type="value">44%</measure> of its overall budget in <measure type="value">2010</measure>. Just like in other professional sports, TV rights are now an important source of revenue, resulting from an organiser"s strategy of using its monopoly power over the Tour de France to increase these rights. From the 1950s to the <measure type="interval" ptr="#8caf561d-0656-4591-8a0a-1ccd45f0a37c">1980s</measure> <quantifiedObject id="8caf561d-0656-4591-8a0a-1ccd45f0a37c">twothirds of</quantifiedObject> Tour de France revenues originated from merchandising and sponsorship. This kind of revenues emerged in <measure type="value">1925</measure>-1929 when the Tour had transformed from a race opposing individual riders into a race between opponent teams sponsored by trademarks and commercial companies. Since 1930, additional sponsorship income was generated with the introduction of a publicity caravan, i.e. dozens of <quantifiedObject id="1e8529e5-0d56-4dd6-b667-1a03c020d1f9">vehicles preceding</quantifiedObject> the riders by a <measure type="value" ptr="#1e8529e5-0d56-4dd6-b667-1a03c020d1f9">few minutes</measure> and distributing product samples to spectators (see chapter 1). The share of advertising and sponsorship revenue has declined in the past <measure type="value">two decades</measure> to <measure type="value" ptr="#e54b3930-d066-48b9-b579-d7b941526102">51%</measure> of the budget in <measure type="value">2010</measure>. Finally, each year over <measure type="value" ptr="#4889b3a1-ede0-4124-b779-0cf0aa6aaf2f">200</measure> <quantifiedObject id="4889b3a1-ede0-4124-b779-0cf0aa6aaf2f">cities</quantifiedObject> are a candidate for hosting a Tour de France stage arrival and/or departure and those who are successful pay between € <measure type="interval">50,000</measure> and € <measure type="interval" ptr="#9d2654df-16d3-46ce-9c5d-87ed706da722">100,000</measure> for this privilege. However, because of the rising overall budget the share of the contributions from these cities in the total budget of the Tour de France has decreased from <measure type="value">40%</measure> in <measure type="interval">1952 to 5%</measure> in <measure type="value">2010</measure>. The Tour de France has thus also evolved towards a contemporary model of professional sports finance and developed from a so-called SSSL (= Spectators, Subsidies, Sponsors, Local) model to a MCMMG (= Media, Corporations, Merchandising, Markets, Global) model with regard to its major sources of finance (Andreff &amp; Staudohar, 2000). In the MCMMG model, media, in particular through TV broadcasting rights, have become a significant source of income for many sports. Furthermore, alongside with sponsors and gate receipts (spectators) whose share in overall finance of sports events has shrunk, new sources of finance have emerged including corporations (investment funds, big companies, Russian oligarchs, Middle Eastern sheiks enriched by oil sales, …), merchandising of non sporting goods (e.g. T-shirts) under a club"s or a player"s label, and markets. With respect to the latter, we see that money is channeled into contemporary professional sports from <measure type="value" ptr="#66ff9118-9d2f-45a0-b877-df77242fafee">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="66ff9118-9d2f-45a0-b877-df77242fafee">markets</quantifiedObject>: a labour market for talent in which a club makes money in selling home-educated and trained talented players and a capital market that enables to trade a club"s shares at the stock exchange and collecting money from the fans as shareholders. Most of these new sources of finance are global.</p><p>From table 1 we also see that although the current Tour de France financing model is in line with big professional sports leagues such as the football English Premier League and the French Ligue 1, it remains specific in a way too. For example, its TV-dependence is slightly lower in percentage of overall revenues compared to football and merchandising and <quantifiedObject id="40d3c8e2-48b6-40ff-abce-6d0f7a3fb80f">sponsorship</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#40d3c8e2-48b6-40ff-abce-6d0f7a3fb80f">51%</measure>) is still a more important source of income to the Tour de France organisers than TV rights revenues. This may be interpreted as either the Tour de France being in a transition phase between the SSSL and MCMMG models, or as a consequence of the absence of gate revenue which must be compensated for by sponsorship money. In fact, the lack of gate revenue potentially deprives the Tour de France of up to a quarter (like in English football) of overall revenues. The share of public money received from municipalities is more important in the Tour de France than in European football though it is now reduced to <measure type="interval">5%</measure> only. At the end of the day, the profitability of the Tour de France is likely to be guaranteed as long as it will attract media, advertisers and sponsors even without any spectatorship income.</p><p>France each year. As described in chapter 2, this is not without conflicting interests between the organisers of the "grand tours" (ASO, RCS and Unipublic) and the UCI claiming that all the Pro Tour teams must be invited in each "grand tour" (Rebeggiani &amp; Tondani, 2008). Total prize money in the Tour de France is now over € <measure type="value">2 million</measure> (for a detailed analysis, see chapter 3) which, compared with other cycling races, is rather fulfilling the prerequisite (b). Since the prize money is distributed over multiple trophies, condition (e) is satisfied as well. Only condition (a) is debatable when one witnesses a rider winning the Tour de France <measure type="value" ptr="#8007ee76-d7d1-4267-abc2-ade6bd74ffae">five</measure> <quantifiedObject id="8007ee76-d7d1-4267-abc2-ade6bd74ffae">times</quantifiedObject> like Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, or, in the case of the later disqualified Lance Armstrong, <measure type="value" ptr="#b80d69b8-fcde-4920-9914-3ca8b3dab1a4">seven</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b80d69b8-fcde-4920-9914-3ca8b3dab1a4">times in</quantifiedObject> a row.</p><p>Condition (a) is not valid either when the yellow jersey winner is too <quantifiedObject id="61507c83-8d88-4e0c-86f8-7727b69a2d58">much ahead of</quantifiedObject> the secondranked rider, like in <measure type="value" ptr="#61507c83-8d88-4e0c-86f8-7727b69a2d58">1952</measure> when Fausto Coppi won the Tour de France with <quantifiedObject id="04283405-ce82-4703-81dd-262843f9d46d">a lead of</quantifiedObject> over <measure type="value" ptr="#04283405-ce82-4703-81dd-262843f9d46d">28 minutes</measure>.</p><p>In fact, condition (a) raises the issue of competitive balance in the Tour de France which is discussed in section 2 below. Finally, prerequisite (f) refers to the distribution of Tour de France prize money across different trophies and best-ranked riders. In the <measure type="value">2014</measure> Tour de France, for every lower position in the general classification the prize money was more or less halved between the first <measure type="value" ptr="#9ce79552-d5cd-4021-bb39-305e83b7ed49">seven</measure> <quantifiedObject id="9ce79552-d5cd-4021-bb39-305e83b7ed49">ranked riders</quantifiedObject>: from <measure type="value" ptr="#425f38ac-337c-4627-96cd-2078ba01a4f0">€ 450,000</measure> for the winner over <measure type="value" ptr="#08e1c621-8525-44f9-89a8-920650f158c8">€ 200,000</measure> for the runner-up to <measure type="value" ptr="#55cbc843-1294-4864-9372-813eaf0a996e">€ 100,000</measure> for the third ranked rider, and so on to € <measure type="value" ptr="#5dca907a-7897-4f8f-a8db-46965ed68389">11,500</measure> for the rider ranked in seventh place. A similar gap is assessed as a strong effort incentive in most individual sports tournaments such as, for example, tennis. With this incentive prize structure a rider who jumps from the seventh to the fifth rank multiplies his financial gains by <measure type="value">four</measure> and the same occurs when a rider jumps from the third to the first place. The prize structure for winning a stage is similar with also approximately a doubling of the monetary reward for <measure type="value">one</measure> rank improvement between the <measure type="value" ptr="#31911609-d350-4c4d-93c2-fa3fb6d69b23">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="31911609-d350-4c4d-93c2-fa3fb6d69b23">best ranked riders</quantifiedObject>. The prize structure for the other trophies is less in tune with tournament theory. In the race for the green, the white and the polka-dot jerseys, financial gains are not doubled when a rider improves his rank by one. These trophies thus clearly have a less incentive prize structure. If one ASO objective is to "multiply the races within the race" this must not go as far as disturbing the contention for the yellow jersey. That is the reason why incentives are significantly lower (€ <measure type="value" ptr="#45afa6a0-eaac-4cf4-abc6-81a1e6599a95">25,000</measure> for the green and polka-dot jersey winners, € <measure type="value" ptr="#ef2835b6-7a4c-457b-807c-2f430f1dd8b3">20,000</measure> for the white jersey winner) and less structured according to the tournament theory for trophies that only appeal to specialised riders like sprinters or climbers.</p><p>When economists attempt to explain a successful attendance and/or TV audience for a sports event, they are used to refer to competitive balance.

In such a case, outcome uncertainty is negligible and the game exhibits a competitive imbalance or a weak competitive balance. If, by chance and as it happens sometimes, the underdog defeats the favourite team, the outcome will be assessed as a "surprise". However, the notion of a surprising sporting outcome is still in the cradle (M. &amp; W.</p><p>This view has been mitigated in recent years. A distinction between <measure type="value" ptr="#c59d1b27-cc0d-4c39-8c6c-7e7f98b239d7">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c59d1b27-cc0d-4c39-8c6c-7e7f98b239d7">types of</quantifiedObject> sport show consumers has been successfully tested. On the one hand, fans and season ticket holders basically expect the greatest possible number of wins from their favourite team and thus care less about competitive balance. On the other hand, TV viewers and casual spectators often care less about the winning team and are attracted by more balanced games. For example, for NBA basketball it has been shown that fans wish at least <measure type="interval">two</measure>-thirds of wins for their favourite team (Rascher &amp; Solmes, 2007).</p><p>Taking the audience interest as a benchmark, the Tour de France would definitely be considered to be a well-balanced competition given its <measure type="interval" ptr="#8f235fb6-9409-4219-8fec-e74f406896c0">10</measure> to 15 million <quantifiedObject id="8f235fb6-9409-4219-8fec-e74f406896c0">people attendance</quantifiedObject>. But since this sport show is offered for free, such a conclusion might be misleading. If one wants to really test the concept of competitive balance, a next issue is to develop an accurate metrics. With team sports, the theoretically best competitive balance for a game is when both teams have a <measure type="value">50%</measure> probability of winning. The most used proxy for this probability consists of comparing the win percentages of the <measure type="value">two</measure> teams and, for the league as a whole, of designing some sort of win dispersion or concentration indices (Andreff, 2012;</p><p>The only (albeit serious) problem with aforementioned indices is that just like any other cycling race, the Tour de France is not a bilateral confrontation between <measure type="value" ptr="#d41487a2-3387-4365-a6ce-6138959fd2dd">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d41487a2-3387-4365-a6ce-6138959fd2dd">teams or</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#a8a22ee5-bbaa-4bad-9c7d-be0a8b0ffb10">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a8a22ee5-bbaa-4bad-9c7d-be0a8b0ffb10">riders and</quantifiedObject> the competitive balance indexes for team sports league thus cannot be applied as such. One cannot derive and calculate a win percentage between, for example, Team Sky and Movistar from their performances in previous cycling races since their sporting outcomes are not the result of a bilateral confrontation but of an overall series of contests with many other cycling teams. Since it is not possible to define bilateral win percentages, another metrics has to be developed. This is all the more the case because road cycling is at the same time an individual sport and a team sport. There is just one yellow jersey winner but all riders are grouped into teams and no one can win the yellow jersey without the work and effort from his teammates. Moreover, given the multiple trophies that are at stake, <measure type="list">two</measure> or more teams often divide labour and co-operate (sometimes collude) in view of winning a specific trophy.</p><p>Mignot (2013) <measure type="interval" ptr="#8a11c5c9-873e-4937-ad2f-36c77f958e3e">1978</measure>-79 and 1981-82), Miguel Indurain (1991-95) and <quantifiedObject id="8a11c5c9-873e-4937-ad2f-36c77f958e3e">Lance Armstrong</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="interval" ptr="#0d24e96c-5411-4635-aae4-94cf865d8df3">1999</measure>- 2005). Although this leads to the impression that the Tour is very imbalanced, the conclusion relies on the performance of only <measure type="value" ptr="#9a6ac5ef-7e05-4fbd-aae3-a15ab8020ef1">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="9a6ac5ef-7e05-4fbd-aae3-a15ab8020ef1">rider</quantifiedObject>, making it even less robust than above. Nevertheless, it means that one feature often associated with outcome uncertainty, namely an unforeseeable sporting result (Neale, 1964) is missing or really weak in Tour de France.</p><p>A common limitation to all previous indexes is that they assess competitive balance only on the basis of <measure type="list" ptr="#164a1fc6-eeb2-48b6-9ee7-f605508c56d2">one</measure> or two <quantifiedObject id="164a1fc6-eeb2-48b6-9ee7-f605508c56d2">riders</quantifiedObject> or, at maximum, of <quantifiedObject id="9b5f12f9-1e37-4f39-b68d-ffb3c4ff8d70">a small number of</quantifiedObject> riders in contention for the yellow jersey as (2008, 2012 and 2013) out of <measure type="value" ptr="#9b5f12f9-1e37-4f39-b68d-ffb3c4ff8d70">seven years</measure>.

Its practical interest is limited in the real world. Another index is required to qualify how much one specific Tour de France is balanced or imbalanced. Here <measure type="value" ptr="#02ac116f-d592-4121-a116-d449cf505ff0">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="02ac116f-d592-4121-a116-d449cf505ff0">options</quantifiedObject> exist. One is to refer to the coefficient of variation  = . A statistical distribution is considered as extremely scattered (i.e. the Tour is extremely imbalanced) when ≥1, and the closer to <measure type="value">zero</measure> the less it is scattered. As a benchmark  may be accepted for concluding that a Tour is balanced. A second option is to compare the observed distribution of team"s actual average times with a Gaussian (or normal) distribution. In the latter, <measure type="value">68.3%</measure> of the population is contained between and . If for a given Tour de France the number of teams comprised within this interval is smaller than <measure type="interval">68.3%</measure>, not only the Tour is imbalanced but it must be assessed as abnormally imbalanced since teams" strengths are less concentrated in the central part of the distribution than in a Gaussian population. Such an imbalanced situation could result from having too many weak teams participating in the Tour de</p><p>France. Conversely, if the number of teams in the above interval is bigger than <measure type="value">68.3%</measure>, then the Tour is less imbalanced than it would have been under the conditions of a Gaussian distribution. The 2010 Tour de France with a <measure type="value">68.2%</measure> of teams within the (; ) interval has a nearly</p><p>Gaussian distribution of teams" strengths and can be taken as a benchmark. Several Tours (2007,2011,2012 Between brackets: the number of teams common between <measure type="value">two</measure> Tours de France *** significant at <measure type="value">1%</measure>; ** significant at <measure type="value">5%</measure>; * significant at <measure type="value">10%</measure></p><p>As a consequence, the above used competitive balance indexes as well as the analyses of sporting success determinants (Torgler, 2007) or team efficiency ( Rogge et al., 2013) in the Tour de France, are for certain distorted to an unknown extent. In fact, they do not include an explanatory or dummy variable supposed to capture the doping effect on rider and team performances. For example, the estimated probability to be ranked among the first <measure type="value">25</measure> riders for the yellow jersey trophy calculated by</p><p>Torgler (2007) Despite the overwhelming evidence on doping, the Tour de France audience has not dropped over the years. A recent inquiry in Flanders (Van Reeth &amp; Lagae, 2014) however, did show that most spectators do prefer "clean" performances in the Tour over doping-prone exceptional results. The study shows they are well aware of doping that plagues the Tour de France. But although they think that it is a problem that will never disappear completely from cycling and thus will continue to affect its credibility, cycling fans do not refrain from attending or watching it on TV, as another study (Van Reeth, 2013) has demonstrated. A new doping case during the Tour de France appears to have no significant immediate impact on average TV audiences of the Tour de France and triggers a small <measure type="value">7.6%</measure> decrease in peak TV audiences. However, the impact of doping seems to have a stronger impact in the year following the unveiling of a major doping case, like the Festina case in <measure type="value">1998</measure> or the Contador case in <measure type="value">2012</measure>. A significant <measure type="value" ptr="#a25ce9ea-8194-4ffd-bbe4-fefdfa7e4660">17.5%</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a25ce9ea-8194-4ffd-bbe4-fefdfa7e4660">decline in</quantifiedObject> average TV audience and a <measure type="value" ptr="#7f5af2e2-96b2-4fe3-a2f5-20fdb750df20">7.7%</measure> <quantifiedObject id="7f5af2e2-96b2-4fe3-a2f5-20fdb750df20">fall in</quantifiedObject> peak TV audience is recorded for the following Tour de France. This impact seems to temporary though since the effect only lasts for <measure type="value">one year</measure>. Although apparently it has not strongly affected Tour attendance and TV audiences so far, doping may still be damaging the Tour success story in the long run. This requires new ideas on how to combat doping in cycling more efficiently.</p><p>A new analytical approach to doping in sports economics relies on game theory. The starting point is to basically assume that riders dope themselves because it corresponds to their deeply rooted economic and financial interests, and not because they are bad by nature, professional cheaters or criminals. <measure type="value" ptr="#2dcf05e1-08bf-4ee9-86bd-ab2adde23ce6">Two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="2dcf05e1-08bf-4ee9-86bd-ab2adde23ce6">papers written</quantifiedObject> in the wake of the Festina scandal (Eber &amp; Thépot, 1999 andBerentsen, 2002) analyse doping as a result of a prisoner"s dilemma, one of the most famous problems in game theory. In a nutshell, the doping game is a prisoner"s dilemma adapted here to cycling where: a/ there is a (financial and health) cost borne by riders when they use doping; b/ the use of doping substances and techniques enables a rider to enhance his performances; c/ if, in an assumed <measure type="value" ptr="#26efd670-7284-420c-b898-838df28755a1">two</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="26efd670-7284-420c-b898-838df28755a1">rider race</quantifiedObject>, both riders dope the final ranking remains unchanged compared to a situation without doping; and d/ if one of the <measure type="value" ptr="#462e27ca-cb98-40bb-90da-fb3ea19d57f8">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="462e27ca-cb98-40bb-90da-fb3ea19d57f8">riders</quantifiedObject> is caught, he will never denounce the other rider for being doped as well. Cycling the latter behaviour is known as omerta or the "law of silence": it is forbidden to openly talk about doping. In such a prisoner"s dilemma, it can be shown that doping is a dominant strategy which means that it is always much more profitable for both riders to dope. The game theoretic literature about doping has also proposed several new anti-doping policy recommendations, all focused on providing riders reduced incentives to use doping. Eber and Thépot (1999) advocate lower spreads between the prizes (which is in conflict with tournament theory), fewer races, improved testing and better prevention.</p><p> At the start of the cycling season, all riders (in accordance with their doctors) must register compulsory the list of all doping substances and techniques they plan or, when necessary, want to use over the whole season. Such a doping diary is secret to the other riders. It could, for example, be deposited in the hands of each rider"s lawyer or with the UCI. Riders fully commit themselves to stick to the self-declared list of doping products.  If,during the season, a rider is tested positive for having taken products listed in his diary, no sanction applies.  However, if a rider is tested positive for having taken products not on this list, the sanction is extremely severe, for example a lifetime ban from professional cycling. A severe sanction is needed because not only did the rider use doping, he also cheated and blurred the transparency required for this scheme to be efficient. Because the rider does not want to comply with the rules of the game, he is excluded from professional cycling forever.  If a rider is performing extremely well, other riders who are suspicious (<quantifiedObject id="af460f6d-0cb7-426d-a357-8b8d3bcac638">anyone of</quantifiedObject> them, under the precondition that they are at least <measure type="value" ptr="#af460f6d-0cb7-426d-a357-8b8d3bcac638">two</measure>) are allowed to ask the rider (or his lawyer or the UCI) to unveil his doping diary in order to check whether the rider complies with it.  If it appears from (4) that the suspected rider does not comply with his doping diary, just like under (3) he is banned for life from professional cycling.  If it appears from (4) that the suspected rider does comply with his doping diary, the <measure type="value" ptr="#88ccd78e-082e-48d9-973a-8e17090d287d">two</measure> or more <quantifiedObject id="88ccd78e-082e-48d9-973a-8e17090d287d">claiming riders</quantifiedObject> have to admit that the suspected rider either is definitely stronger than they are during this season or that his doping diary is more efficient or better programmed than their own.</p><p> As a result of this scheme, in particular at the beginning of such a regulation when there may be many claims against successful riders, other riders would have an incentive to copy the unveiled doping diary of the winners. This would trigger <measure type="value" ptr="#d7b1e73c-8d06-419f-8e1e-b862fb9f0dd3">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d7b1e73c-8d06-419f-8e1e-b862fb9f0dd3">beneficial incentives</quantifiedObject>. First, step by step a doping norm (diary) will prevail in the whole peloton, a typical story of social norm formation. All riders will start to use the same most efficient or best conceived doping programme. Second, because of this social norm formation, riders will soon realize that the differential and artificial competitive advantage of hidden doping is limited and short-lived. Third, the omerta system will vanish because the best doping programme will be publicly known to and consequently openly used by all riders once the most performing doping diaries of suspected winners are unveiled.  Once riders are convinced that doping becomes useless as soon as doping substances and techniques are no longer differential between riders, it will not be very difficult to convince them that a same optimal doping recipe does not imply "the more the better".</p><p>Moreover, such anti-doping regulation features an incentive scheme where each rider is not interested in more and more doping for himself, but instead is interested in benefiting from a competitor"s decision to over-dope beyond his declared programme. To illustrate this point, imagine a <measure type="value">four</measure>-rider racing circuit that operates under the above regulation. It will produce the following incentive scheme: He can expect a share increase though when competitors over-dope beyond their diary. The outcome is that each rider"s interest is to let the others over-dope and yield a higher share in wins from their exclusion. The incentive scheme is efficient and works in the right direction. Each rider becomes unwilling to over-dope or cheat whatever the others do and benefits in terms of wins from the wrong over-doping strategy possibly adopted by competitors. Doping thus shows a self-defeating strategy and will ultimately be rejected by most riders.</p><p>Should one be optimistic about the above-suggested anti-doping regulation? For certain, it must not be considered to be a miracle solution. But the proposal at least focuses on a crucial point that could possibly be elaborated a bit further in forthcoming studies: the incentive scheme must convince riders that as soon as doping diaries are not differential between riders, doping is no longer a strategy that enables them to win more than their natural ability warrants. It may happen that there will be significant transition costs between the current anti-doping system and the one proposed here. In the first periods of the new regulation enforcement, some riders may feel or assume that the best performing doping programme is the most overloaded one. These riders might use substances dangerous to their health or life. If this assumption reveals to be true, they will soon be copied by other riders and lose their temporary comparative advantage. If on the contrary the assumption were to be wrong, or after a temporary increase in the number of sicknesses and deaths in the peloton (a sort of transition crisis between the <measure type="value" ptr="#90ec3128-23b1-4ace-ab93-d4c9ff79bf68">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="90ec3128-23b1-4ace-ab93-d4c9ff79bf68">anti-doping systems</quantifiedObject>, the hard price to pay for adopting the second one), all riders would be convinced that the best or optimal doping programme is in no way the most comprehensive or dangerous one in terms. It might be difficult though to convince stakeholders in cycling to enforce such a new regulation. Although riders would probably soon understand the mechanics of the embedded incentive scheme, they might be more concerned about the short-term effects of such a scheme on their health, i.e. when dangerous substances are put on the doping diary list (and subsequently used) by a large number of riders. But significant obstacles might also come from cycling governing bodies such as the UCI, Tour de France organisers ASO, and so on. They might especially fear the transparency about doping practices in the peloton that would result under such a regulation and its impact on the image (and thus the economic value) of cycling. Why not try to convince them as well that the good incentives that the proposed scheme creates are always preferable to the current bad incentives?</p></text>
