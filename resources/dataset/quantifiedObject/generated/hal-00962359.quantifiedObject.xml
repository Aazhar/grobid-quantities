	<p>The high-volume fly ash concrete (HVFAC) system has emerged as a future power<quantifiedObject id="60e48a50-fc24-440a-85c8-2eaea7453e02">ful concrete system that would be f</quantifiedObject>ar more durable and resource-efficient than those made of conventional Portland cement concrete.

The Confederation of Indian Industry; centre of excellence for sustainable development [2] proposed that for obtaining a superior performance of HVFAC, the water-to-cementitious ratio should be bellow <measure type="list">0.4</measure> and preferably â‰¤ <measure type="interval">0.35</measure> .The use of superplasticizer is most of the time essential.</p>
	<p>[3] defined a HVFAC as a concrete in which at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#4264d234-a727-4e56-8023-c83f1c5e0dbd" pos="left">50</measure> <quantifiedObject id="4264d234-a727-4e56-8023-c83f1c5e0dbd">percent by</quantifiedObject> weight or mass of the cementitious material content is the fly ash. The applications (such as foundations) where strengths of <measure type="interval">21 to 28 MPa</measure> are acceptable and high early strength is not required may be produced without special admixtures. Compared to the conventional Portland concrete, the HVFAC has some qualities: lower cost, very high environmental benefits (reduced CO 2 ), easier flowability and workability, negligible bleeding, quicker finishing, <quantifiedObject id="14b1b660-911c-4fa2-a049-104527bb847b">higher ultimate strength</quantifiedObject> up to <measure type="value" ptr="#14b1b660-911c-4fa2-a049-104527bb847b" pos="right">90 days</measure>, higher crack resistance, very <quantifiedObject id="7dc5c2eb-925c-411c-9f25-3aa5d45d8946">higher resistance to</quantifiedObject> penetration of chloride ions after <measure type="value" ptr="#7dc5c2eb-925c-411c-9f25-3aa5d45d8946" pos="right">3 months</measure> and very <quantifiedObject id="420a0cdd-33a3-4060-943b-4463e88ba0b4">higher electrical resistivity after</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#420a0cdd-33a3-4060-943b-4463e88ba0b4" pos="right">3 months</measure>.</p>
	<p>About the volume the emissions of greenhouse gases which can be reduced, Ehrenberg and Geisler [4] wrote that the replacement of <measure type="value" ptr="#41da02cb-21b5-43e1-9ce7-bdd61cd49e90" pos="left">1</measure> <quantifiedObject id="41da02cb-21b5-43e1-9ce7-bdd61cd49e90">ton of</quantifiedObject> Portland cement by the fly ash reduces the overall CO 2 emissions by approximately 1 ton. Langley et al. [5] specified that another benefit of using fly ash in concrete is that fly ash makes beautiful architectural concrete because its light in color and its extreme workability ensures smoother finishes. In addition, fly ash in plaster virtually eliminates defects like crazing, map cracking, drying shrinkage cracks, grinning, expansion and popping.</p>
	<p>With the aim to contribute to the study of the compressive and flexural loading resistance for a considerable volume fly ash concrete, a total of <measure type="value" ptr="#17aff14f-991f-4f68-bb59-9ca96a907370" pos="left">144</measure> <quantifiedObject id="17aff14f-991f-4f68-bb59-9ca96a907370">samples</quantifiedObject> were made in the concrete laboratory (<measure type="value">72</measure> for compressive test and <measure type="value">72</measure> for flexural test).</p>
	<p>The methods used for making the fly ash concrete were based on materials proportioning system according to the percent of the cementitious contents. The Table 3-1 and the Table 3-2 show respectively our proposition for materials proportioning and the volume of materials. For compressive samples the moulds size is <measure type="value">150mm</measure> cubic while for flexural samples the size is <measure type="value">100 mm x 100 mm x 400 mm</measure>.</p>
	<p>The concrete -mixer used could mix at once concrete whose volume is the total volume of <measure type="value" ptr="#696d725e-b33b-4a33-8215-0a776ca727bc" pos="left">6</measure> <quantifiedObject id="696d725e-b33b-4a33-8215-0a776ca727bc">samples</quantifiedObject> for compressive test and <measure type="value" ptr="#26733903-f522-4888-bdee-62222a1bde35" pos="left">6</measure> <quantifiedObject id="26733903-f522-4888-bdee-62222a1bde35">samples for</quantifiedObject> flexural test . The slump test was done for each fresh concrete and the measure was ranged between <measure type="interval">120 and 180mm</measure>. For making the concrete more compact and homogeneous, a vibrating table was used.</p>
	<p>Compressive strength is the capacity of a material to withstand axially directed pushing forces. Whe<quantifiedObject id="29c7475a-7820-478c-b59f-1df70475ebdf">n the </quantifiedObject>limit of compressive strength is reached, materials are crushed. The cubic concrete specimen is placed on the platform of compression testing machine without any packing between the cube and the steel platens of the testing machine. The load is then applied on a smooth surface on the cube steadily and uniform starting from <measure type="value" ptr="#29c7475a-7820-478c-b59f-1df70475ebdf" pos="right">zero</measure> at <quantifiedObject id="ee385d98-8730-4635-b08e-1676111e1206">a rate of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#ee385d98-8730-4635-b08e-1676111e1206" pos="right">35 N/mm 2 /min</measure> till the cube fails.</p>
	<p>The flexural test is one measure of the tensile strength of concrete. It is a measure of an unreinforced concrete to resist failure in bending. The specimen is placed symmetrically on the load-applying and support blocks. In the present test, the distance between the support-block axis and the extremity of the specimen is <measure type="value">50 mm</measure>. The load is then rapidly applied until approximately <measure type="value" ptr="#9ae9c182-b648-439a-99e8-ee4b6be37754" pos="right">50 percent</measure> of the breaking load has been reached.</p>
