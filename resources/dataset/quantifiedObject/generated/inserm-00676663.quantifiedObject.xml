	<p>Anecdotal reports show that some older athletes nowadays can achieve very high levels of ultra-endurance performance (defined as performance exceeding <measure type="interval" ptr="#aa69e5e0-8e0f-4a58-b4b9-06872eb7b48f" pos="left">6</measure> <quantifiedObject id="aa69e5e0-8e0f-4a58-b4b9-06872eb7b48f">h</quantifiedObject>, Zaryski &amp; Smith 2005).

That same year, and at the same event, a <measure type="value">75 year</measure> old female triathlete finished the race in http://ironmanworldchampionship.com/results/ 16h <measure type="value">20min</measure>. These unique older athletes have begun to push the limits of the interaction between aging and human endurance. They represent a positive example of healthy aging and provide unique insights into a person s ability to maintain physical performance and ' physiological function with advancing age (Tanaka and Seals 2008).</p>
	<p>Age-related declines in endurance performance have been well described in the literature for running (Trappe 2007, Leyk et al 2009, Lepers &amp; Cattagni 2011), swimming (Tanaka &amp; Seals 2008) and triathlon ( Bernard et al. 2010, Baker et al. 2010). Changes in performance across the ages have also been examined for ultra-endurance events, including running events of <measure type="interval" ptr="#63727c60-17f7-4acd-9e30-e5aab5600449" pos="left">50 to 161-km</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="63727c60-17f7-4acd-9e30-e5aab5600449">km</quantifiedObject> (Hoffman &amp; Wegelin 2009, Hoffman et al. 2010, Knechtle et al. 2011) and Ironman distance triathlons ( Lepers et al. 2010, Lepers &amp; Maffiuletti 2011).</p>
	<p>Endurance and ultra-endurance performance, in terms of the overall time taken, appears to be maintained until approximately <measure type="interval">35 40 years</measure> -of age, followed by modest decreases until <measure type="value" ptr="#4d342844-726f-4f6c-b091-b78614e3ed4e" pos="left">50 years</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="4d342844-726f-4f6c-b091-b78614e3ed4e">age</quantifiedObject>, with a progressive decrease in performance thereafter with the greatest declines occurring after <quantifiedObject id="dca9106f-1255-47c7-8b78-046b8098000f">the age of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#dca9106f-1255-47c7-8b78-046b8098000f" pos="right">70 years</measure>. Physiological factors, both central (maximum heart rate; maximum stroke volume; blood volume) and peripheral (muscle mass; muscle fiber composition, size and capillarization; muscle enzyme activity), contribute to age-related declines in endurance performance in older athletes. However, these physiological factors can be regulated by changing the intensity and volume of the older endurance athletes training (Reaburn &amp; Dascombe 2008, Tanaka &amp; Seals 2008 and there is obviously an interaction between participation and performance trends of masters athletes. An increase in participation of both male and female athletes older than <measure type="interval" ptr="#63eef305-ebbe-405d-9c75-77b3ece508dd" pos="left">40</measure> <quantifiedObject id="63eef305-ebbe-405d-9c75-77b3ece508dd">yrs</quantifiedObject> has been reported for <measure type="value" ptr="#e2722375-2950-4b08-a534-b82d1b89b5f1" pos="left">161-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e2722375-2950-4b08-a534-b82d1b89b5f1">ultra-marathons</quantifiedObject> in North America over the past <measure type="value">30 years</measure> ( Hoffman et al. 2010) and for <measure type="value" ptr="#d54253ba-2075-4aaa-a5b8-e7188a409b96" pos="left">100-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d54253ba-2075-4aaa-a5b8-e7188a409b96">running in</quantifiedObject> Switzerland ( Knechtle et al. 2011) during the last <measure type="value">ten years</measure>, but no data are available for a multi-sport ultra-endurance event, such the Ironman triathlon. An increased participation of masters athletes in such ultra-endurance events may inevitably be linked to an increase in training volume, and could be interpreted as a possible strategy for maintaining good health during old age; these older athletes being conscious that regular physical activity may increase life expectancy.</p>
	<p>Ironman triathlon represents an intriguing model to analyse age-related declines in ultra-endurance performance. Indeed, the age-related declines in performance can be analyzed in the same subjects collectively, and also for <measure type="value" ptr="#06b39b3b-617b-45c1-b144-c2dd5bde6689" pos="left">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="06b39b3b-617b-45c1-b144-c2dd5bde6689">modes of</quantifiedObject> locomotion (swimming, cycling and running) separately ( Bernard et al. 2010, Lepers et al. 2010, Lepers &amp; Maffiuletti 2011. It has been shown for example, that age-related declines in cycling performance were less pronounced compared to running, presumably due to the non-weight bearing aspect and the concentric type of muscle action during cycling. According to previous investigations on the participation trends conducted on ultra-endurance running events ( Hoffman et al. 2010, Knechtle et al. 2011), we would also expect an increase in the participation of masters triathletes in an ultra-endurance competitions such Ironman triathlon since <quantifiedObject id="b2202007-0a64-4805-8332-6760280cc06c">the emergence of</quantifiedObject> this sport in the <measure type="interval" ptr="#b2202007-0a64-4805-8332-6760280cc06c" pos="right">1980 s</measure> (Lepers 2008).</p>
	<p>In accordance with this expected increase in participation, it may also be interesting to see if older Ironman triathletes have shown improvements in their swimming, cycling and running <quantifiedObject id="952210ea-3424-46af-8a00-7f439211eeb6">performance over</quantifiedObject> the past <measure type="value" ptr="#952210ea-3424-46af-8a00-7f439211eeb6" pos="right">3 decades</measure>.</p>
	<p>A previous study conducted on the Hawaii Ironman triathlon showed that gender differences in total performance time were stable until <measure type="interval" ptr="#e9be42ec-2eab-49ef-95a6-54b3c6d773cb" pos="left">55 yrs</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="e9be42ec-2eab-49ef-95a6-54b3c6d773cb">age</quantifiedObject> but increased thereafter (Lepers &amp; Maffiuletti 2011). However, this study focused only on a recent <measure type="value" ptr="#d98ecc7b-32e0-4344-b0cf-5c4fd83cfd62" pos="left">three-year</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d98ecc7b-32e0-4344-b0cf-5c4fd83cfd62">period</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="interval" ptr="#1ad7246e-7d52-4596-b72b-1f8588accce0" pos="right">2006 2008</measure>) and did not examine the possible differences between the genders with age since the beginning of the event in the early <measure type="interval" ptr="#01413f15-ffde-4a2e-86fb-04d2699153fd" pos="left">1980</measure> -<quantifiedObject id="01413f15-ffde-4a2e-86fb-04d2699153fd">' s.</quantifiedObject> If the changes in age-related decline in performance differed between males and females over the past <measure type="value">three decades</measure>, we would also expect some change in the difference between gender performances across the ages.</p>
	<p>To date, no data exist regarding the participation and performance trends of masters athletes in <quantifiedObject id="903d6280-3bc2-44c6-9acf-f9e1a9373d2d">a multi-sport ultra-endurance event</quantifiedObject> such as the Ironman triathlon in the last <measure type="value" ptr="#903d6280-3bc2-44c6-9acf-f9e1a9373d2d" pos="right">25 years</measure>. Accordingly, the first purpose of this large cross-sectional study was to examine the changes in participation and performance of masters triathletes at the Ironman triathlon World Championship over the last <measure type="value">25 years</measure> (from <measure type="interval">1986 to 2010</measure>). A secondary purpose was to analyze the gender differences in Ironman triathlon performance as a function of age across the same <measure type="interval" ptr="#0611f5c6-7c10-4a6e-a6bb-b75f61d5d2f8" pos="left">1986 2010</measure> <quantifiedObject id="0611f5c6-7c10-4a6e-a6bb-b75f61d5d2f8">period</quantifiedObject>. In this study, we focused on the performance of the best master triathletes of each age-group (i.e. the top <measure type="value" ptr="#0f4f499f-487a-4b9e-9d2f-3b0f816dc28a" pos="left">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="0f4f499f-487a-4b9e-9d2f-3b0f816dc28a">performer</quantifiedObject> -of each <measure type="value" ptr="#b7694bd9-d92b-4a9e-b331-2aee1682dd6c" pos="left">5-year</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b7694bd9-d92b-4a9e-b331-2aee1682dd6c">age-group</quantifiedObject>) because these athletes present a unique model for studying the effects of high levels of physical training in older age.</p>
	<p>Approval for this study was obtained from the Burgundy University Committee on Human Research. It involved the analysis of publicly available data so content was waived. Age and time performance data for all triathletes completing the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon from <measure type="interval">1986 to 2010</measure> were obtained through the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon web site:</p>
	<p>. In the http://ironmanworldchampionship.com/results/ present paper, we focus our attention on the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon, which has become the Ironman World Championship i.e. the premier race in the field of long distance triathlon (Lepers 2008). In order to participate at the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon, all triathletes must earn a qualifying slot at one of the qualifying Ironman triathlons held worldwide during the previous year (http://ironman.com/events performances. Averaged swimming, cycling, running and total time performances of the top <measure type="value" ptr="#102d384b-d6f1-4982-9e2a-8b738eda3488" pos="left">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="102d384b-d6f1-4982-9e2a-8b738eda3488">finishers of</quantifiedObject> each age group for both females and males were analyzed from <measure type="interval">1986 to 2010</measure>.

	<p>In order to limit the influence of environmental conditions and small changes in the courses in the comparison of performance, the swimming, cycling, running and overall time performances of each triathlete finishing in the top <measure type="value" ptr="#b7c02355-72e9-46b1-8465-4cb1a12e52b1" pos="left">10</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="b7c02355-72e9-46b1-8465-4cb1a12e52b1">each age group</quantifiedObject> were divided by the mean time performance of the top <measure type="value" ptr="#acc074dc-96d2-4b28-95e8-79a3164f3d51" pos="left">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="acc074dc-96d2-4b28-95e8-79a3164f3d51">overall finishers</quantifiedObject>.

Thus, the age-related declines in performance were expressed using a performance ratio calculated between the individual and the mean time performances of the top <measure type="value" ptr="#67341f9f-a0ec-4e58-a59c-b52aec8f20a7" pos="left">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="67341f9f-a0ec-4e58-a59c-b52aec8f20a7">overall finishers</quantifiedObject> for each mode of locomotion and total event time ( Lepers et al 2010). This normalization procedure assisted the comparison of age-related declines in performance across the years for both males and females.</p>
	<p>The magnitude of gender differences in total time performance of each age group was examined by calculating the difference in total times between the top <measure type="value" ptr="#9009f618-996a-4e69-a7e9-0eff3bb520d7" pos="left">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="9009f618-996a-4e69-a7e9-0eff3bb520d7">males versus females</quantifiedObject> as a percentage of the average time for the top <measure type="value" ptr="#adfd1629-6cb0-4a84-9d70-e227ab626e70" pos="left">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="adfd1629-6cb0-4a84-9d70-e227ab626e70">males</quantifiedObject> for each year from <measure type="interval" ptr="#8f49111c-a350-4c69-ae7c-aed4f27d7708" pos="right">1986 to 2010</measure>.</p>
	<p>Data is reported as means SD in the text. Linear regressions analyses were used to estimate changes in the selected variables in each ± year of the race. Pearson s correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between various variables using Statsoft (Version ' 6.1, Statistica, Tulsa, OK, USA). Linear regression analyses were used to assess changes in the percentage of finishers in the different age-groups for both sexes across the years, the mean performance ratios for swimming, cycling, running and total event times, for males and females within the different age-groups, and gender differences in total time performances.

	<p>The main findings of the present study were first that the participation of masters triathletes at the Hawaii Ironman triathlon increased during the <measure type="interval" ptr="#01317360-2c2c-4996-807f-5f059d191bbe" pos="left">1986 2010</measure> <quantifiedObject id="01317360-2c2c-4996-807f-5f059d191bbe">period</quantifiedObject>. Second, during that period, female triathletes older than <measure type="interval" ptr="#687d97bd-53f6-4a19-80fc-f6f0c5ecd6d1" pos="left">40</measure> <quantifiedObject id="687d97bd-53f6-4a19-80fc-f6f0c5ecd6d1">years and</quantifiedObject> male triathletes older than <measure type="interval" ptr="#02202326-c1bd-4dd2-b6d0-21ba1b025dc3" pos="left">44</measure> <quantifiedObject id="02202326-c1bd-4dd2-b6d0-21ba1b025dc3">years</quantifiedObject> -significantly improved their swimming, cycling, running and total time performances in the most recent years, relative to performances recorded at the beginning of the time period studied. Third, gender differences in total Ironman triathlon time decreased over the last <measure type="value" ptr="#32942cb2-dfb4-425a-bedb-e7143f5cc445" pos="right">25 years</measure> for masters age-groups while it remained stable for the young age-group, <measure type="interval">18 39 yrs</measure>. Our data suggest that similar trends have occurred in Ironman triathlon racing over the last <measure type="value">10 years</measure> and we can expect that the participation of female master will continue to increase in the future to soon reach <measure type="value" ptr="#bf8be8f1-5406-49db-8cfc-09868c186a26" pos="right">half</measure> of the total female field. Different factors could be used to explain the increase in participation of masters Ironman triathletes. With the increase in life expectancy and training facilities, such as specific masters programs, the increased participation of older athletes described may be a reflection that these athletes, who are perhaps retired, have more available time and resources at their disposal to train and therefore to compete. The relative increase in participation of older Ironman triathletes could result from a relative decrease in Ironman triathletes in <quantifiedObject id="0467c2da-946d-475e-819a-9a7833287e4d">the younger age groups</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="interval" ptr="#0467c2da-946d-475e-819a-9a7833287e4d" pos="right">18 39 years</measure>). Younger triathletes maybe more and more attracted by shorter distances such as short distance and -half-Ironman distance triathlons. Indeed, since <measure type="interval" ptr="#c6a39872-0714-40cb-ab49-6fff7ed1ed17" pos="left">2000</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c6a39872-0714-40cb-ab49-6fff7ed1ed17">short distance triathlon</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value">1.5km</measure> swim, <measure type="value" ptr="#558fa8c9-49d5-4d93-ae2e-3181c296306e" pos="left">40 km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="558fa8c9-49d5-4d93-ae2e-3181c296306e">cycle and</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#02d90dbd-de27-49cc-b036-f46be4e35a8a" pos="left">40</measure> <quantifiedObject id="02d90dbd-de27-49cc-b036-f46be4e35a8a">run</quantifiedObject>) became an Olympic sport and it may have increased the popularity of the short distance especially in the young triathlete field. With advancing age, athletes naturally move towards longer distances where endurance capacities play a greater role in performance than maximal oxygen consumption. It has been suggested that enjoyment, health, fitness benefits, and social factors are the primary drivers for sport involvement with advancing age (Shaw &amp; Ostrow 2005). For masters triathletes that are more achievement-oriented, there is no doubt that competition, personal challenge and skill development may also be strong reasons for their participation in ultra-endurance events. However, among older triathletes, the distinction between people who started training in triathlon later in life (i.e. after <measure type="interval">40</measure> yrs age) and people who participated in triathlon at a younger age is not known.</p>
	<p>The present results show that swimming, cycling, running and total performance times decreased over the <measure type="value" ptr="#92259d3d-1c23-449a-a9a9-5510951ddda2" pos="left">25-year</measure> <quantifiedObject id="92259d3d-1c23-449a-a9a9-5510951ddda2">periods studied</quantifiedObject> for male triathletes older than <measure type="interval" ptr="#0732b517-565f-4339-bc11-64ef57bd0218" pos="left">44</measure> yrs <quantifiedObject id="0732b517-565f-4339-bc11-64ef57bd0218">age</quantifiedObject> and female triathletes older than 40 yrs age. Several reasons may explain the improved performance of masters triathletes, such as a greater participation of the older age groups, which would increase the probability of finding better triathletes in these age groups, increased training facilities for older people, and increases in the competitive spirit in these older groups. These last years, the age-related declines in total Ironman triathlon performance with advancing age until <measure type="value" ptr="#c2b5a18c-94c1-4cf6-b162-e43d774ec7d6" pos="right">70 yrs</measure> of age was about <measure type="interval">12</measure>-13 per decade for males and <measure type="interval">14 15</measure> per decade for females, respectively. These values are in accordance with those found by Lepers &amp; % -% Cattagni (2011) for the New-York marathon running, but appear greater compared to those found in <measure type="value">100-km</measure> ultra-marathon running (<measure type="interval">7 8</measure> -%</p>

(2011). These findings may be explained by the shorter -% duration of <measure type="value" ptr="#02caeb4a-5613-41dd-a66a-f82a6765ffcb" pos="left">100-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="02caeb4a-5613-41dd-a66a-f82a6765ffcb">running</quantifiedObject> compared to Ironman triathlon, and the different level of competitiveness between the <measure type="value" ptr="#4fbc5ba6-94af-4dc2-97c8-da476a225a51" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="4fbc5ba6-94af-4dc2-97c8-da476a225a51">events</quantifiedObject>: regional one for the <measure type="value" ptr="#809a27f6-fd30-4426-8434-47133eb74238" pos="left">100-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="809a27f6-fd30-4426-8434-47133eb74238">running World Championship</quantifiedObject> for Ironman triathlon. Our data also confirm previous observations (Bernard et al. vs. 2010, Lepers et al. 2010) showing a lesser age-related decline in cycling performance compared with running and swimming performances in triathlon. Physiological (e.g. concentric muscle contractions) and mechanical (e.g. relation between mechanical power output and velocity, non-weight bearing aspect) specificities of cycling compared with the <measure type="value" ptr="#66387b85-bd0a-4c75-bacb-e0700a28ef23" pos="left">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="66387b85-bd0a-4c75-bacb-e0700a28ef23">other disciplines</quantifiedObject> may be explained by the lower age-related decline in cycling performance ( Bernard et al. 2010, Lepers et al. 2010). In the context of health promotion, this finding suggests that cycling may represent an optimal activity with advancing age.</p>
	<p>The question of whether the masters triathletes have reached their limits in Ironman triathlon performance can therefore be raised, at least for the age-group categories studied (i.e. between <measure type="interval">40 69 yrs</measure> for males and <measure type="interval" ptr="#89c724db-6bd3-4a9e-902e-bf0302451b52" pos="left">40 64 yrs</measure> for <quantifiedObject id="89c724db-6bd3-4a9e-902e-bf0302451b52">females</quantifiedObject>). For marathon running, it has been</p>
	<p>The current Hawaii Ironman triathlon record is <measure type="value">8:54:202</measure> for females and <measure type="interval">8:04:08</measure> for males (see Table 2), corresponding to <quantifiedObject id="88c9f7ff-384a-42c9-8f8c-eeb75b661007">a gender gap of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#88c9f7ff-384a-42c9-8f8c-eeb75b661007" pos="right">10.3</measure> . The present results showed that for masters triathletes, the gender differences in Ironman triathlon performance times % decreased over the last <measure type="value">25 years</measure>, suggesting that masters females have reduced the gap to males. During these last years, gender differences in total event performance times remained slightly greater for age groups &gt; <measure type="interval" ptr="#a40671fd-fdeb-4d2b-8228-529e050b49c1" pos="left">54</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a40671fd-fdeb-4d2b-8228-529e050b49c1">yrs</quantifiedObject> compared to youngest age groups. This finding corroborates the results of Lepers &amp; Maffiuletti (2011) who showed that gender differences in Ironman triathlon <quantifiedObject id="edb22d96-d03e-4854-bcd4-1ab2cf155957">performance times analyzed</quantifiedObject> from <measure type="interval" ptr="#edb22d96-d03e-4854-bcd4-1ab2cf155957" pos="right">2006 to 2008</measure> increased with advancing age from <measure type="interval" ptr="#e2e6b4ca-d99a-4ab5-9fb7-2e62d57224f2" pos="left">55</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e2e6b4ca-d99a-4ab5-9fb7-2e62d57224f2">yrs</quantifiedObject>. In contrast, it has been shown that gender difference in New-York marathon running performances did not significantly change across this age group over the past decade (Lepers &amp; Cattagni 2011). Ironman triathlon is a newer ultra-endurance event with less participants compared to the NYC Marathon, which may explain why gender differences across the ages groups in Ironman triathlon are currently similar to those that were observed for marathon <measure type="value">30 yrs</measure> ago.</p>
	<p>Most healthcare providers would agree that racing an Ironman triathlon after <measure type="value" ptr="#eea29c21-b742-49f8-90b3-e1f5c16a7809" pos="left">50 years</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="eea29c21-b742-49f8-90b3-e1f5c16a7809">age</quantifiedObject> is not good for the body.

	<p>The participation of older triathletes at the World Ironman triathlon championship has increased over the <measure type="interval" ptr="#c2e701c6-93f1-4898-a280-d6e387f961a2" pos="left">1986 2010</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c2e701c6-93f1-4898-a280-d6e387f961a2">period</quantifiedObject> and it will -probably still grow in the future in Hawaii and other Ironman triathlons worldwide. During that period master triathletes have shown relative improvements of their performances in the <measure type="value" ptr="#b3a249c0-c3ef-4926-810c-9ad99bf41077" pos="left">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b3a249c0-c3ef-4926-810c-9ad99bf41077">disciplines</quantifiedObject> and in total event times.

The question whether older triathletes have yet reached limits in their performance during Ironman triathlon should therefore be raised. Further studies investigating training regimes, competition experience or socio-demographic factors are needed to gain better insights into the phenomenon of the relative improvement in ultra-endurance performance with advancing age.</p>
