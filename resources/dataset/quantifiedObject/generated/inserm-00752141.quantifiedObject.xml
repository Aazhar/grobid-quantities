	<p>Background: The age-related decline in performance has been investigated in swimmers, runners and triathletes. No study has investigated the age-related performance decline in ultra-triathletes. The purpose of this study was to analyse the age-related declines in swimming, cycling, running and overall race time for both Triple Iron ultra-triathlon (<measure type="value" ptr="#09787dc0-0978-4e25-bd43-5fe528e9c79d">11.4-km</measure> swimming, 540-km <quantifiedObject id="09787dc0-0978-4e25-bd43-5fe528e9c79d">cycling and</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#2b19ef04-5223-4dc8-8af9-ef0f443b4c33">126.6-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="2b19ef04-5223-4dc8-8af9-ef0f443b4c33">running</quantifiedObject>) and Deca Iron ultra-triathlon (<measure type="value" ptr="#72dd15ab-2431-4de7-b5e2-5a158f200acc">38-km</measure> swimming, 1,800-km <quantifiedObject id="72dd15ab-2431-4de7-b5e2-5a158f200acc">cycling and</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#c34c4c58-e799-4301-b67f-77b4646e47bb">420-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c34c4c58-e799-4301-b67f-77b4646e47bb">running</quantifiedObject>).</p>

However, with increasing age, the endurance performance decreases.

	<p>Considering the age-related decline in male ultraendurance athletes, Hoffman investigated ultra-marathoners competing over <measure type="value">161 kilometres</measure> [7][8][9]. Beyond <quantifiedObject id="dfed625c-9a4f-44e0-a68f-37e3e911953f">the age of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#dfed625c-9a4f-44e0-a68f-37e3e911953f">30 to 39 years</measure>, the average finishing times increased linearly with increasing age. The <measure type="interval">30-to 39-year</measure>-old males showed the fastest races times, with athletes in younger and older age groups being slower. The <measure type="interval">40-to 49-year</measure> age group was approximately <measure type="value">4.0%</measure> slower than the <measure type="interval">30 to 39 years</measure> one [8].

Both the moderate decline in running performance and the large number of successful master athletes suggest that master athletes are able to maintain a high degree of physiological performance with increasing age [17]. For Ironman triathletes, both an increase in participation and an improvement in performance in master athletes have recently been reported [18,19].</p>
	<p>The multi-sport discipline triathlon involves successively the <measure type="value">three</measure> endurance disciplines: swimming, cycling and running.

	<p>Regarding the performance in a triathlon, the association of different characteristics in physiology [30][31][32][33], anthropometry [34][35][36][37], training [34,35,38] and <quantifiedObject id="62f980ea-81de-4c59-81d0-2a6766822336">previous experience</quantifiedObject> [28,36,<measure type="list" ptr="#62f980ea-81de-4c59-81d0-2a6766822336">37</measure>,39,40] with race time has been investigated. Apart from these characteristics, an agerelated decline has been described for Olympic distance triathletes [20][21][22][23] as well as for Ironman triathletes [22,25]. It seems that the length of an endurance performance has an influence of the age-related performance decline. In short distance triathletes, a significant decline in performance starts at <quantifiedObject id="a5a3b5c7-1663-4734-a23d-042f89af2edd">the age of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#a5a3b5c7-1663-4734-a23d-042f89af2edd">45 to 50 years</measure> [20,23].

	<p>These are the performances of the different age groups at the Deca Iron triathlon (Data were pooled from <measure type="interval">1992 to 2010</measure> The aim of this study was to analyse the age-related declines in swimming, cycling, running and total performances in male Triple and Deca Iron ultra-triathletes.

However, in contrast to Triple Iron ultra-triathletes, Deca Iron ultra-triathletes can achieve the same level of performance in swimming and cycling between <measure type="interval" ptr="#1740aa02-2411-4837-9a22-90ef47c9727f">25 and 54 years</measure> of age.</p>
	<p>A main interesting finding was that the age-related decline occurred later in swimming and cycling compared to<quantifiedObject id="c410c225-b3fb-4d3d-8678-5a190f0ebffe"> running at t</quantifiedObject>he Deca Iron ultra-triathlon distance. Previous studies suggested that the age-related decline in triathlon performance was specific to the discipline, with cycling showing fewer declines in performance with age than running in both short distance and Ironman triathletes [20,22]. The present results showed that the swimming and cycling performances were maintained until the age of <measure type="interval" ptr="#c410c225-b3fb-4d3d-8678-5a190f0ebffe">54</measure> for the Deca Iron ultra-triathletes but only until <quantifiedObject id="10668c99-2d3b-4819-a172-1beefd1335a6">the age of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#10668c99-2d3b-4819-a172-1beefd1335a6">44</measure> for the Triple Iron ultra-triathletes. A potential explanation for this finding could be pre-race experience. It has been shown that previous experience was a strong predictor for a successful finish in an ultra-triathlon [28,39].

The contribution of swimming to overall ultra-triathlon performance was lower than for cycling and running. Running performance was more important to overall performance for Double Iron ultra-triathlon and Triple Iron ultra-triathlon compared to Deca Iron ultra-triathlon. The Double Iron ultra-triathlon and Triple Iron ultra-triathlon performances were significantly correlated to Deca Iron ultra-triathlon performances for swimming and cycling, but not for running.</p>
	<p>Since the age-related performance started to decline later in an Ironman distance triathlon than in an Olympic distance triathlon, we hypothesised that the agerelated decline in performance would o<quantifiedObject id="800bc026-8a8a-44e0-9e55-47df40ac845b">ccur later for Deca Iron ultra</quantifiedObject>-triathletes than for Triple Iron ultra- triathletes and the fastest performance in a Deca Iron ultra-triathlon would be achieved at a higher age than in a Triple Iron ultra-triathlon. In contrast to our hypothesis, the age of the best overall performance did not differ between Triple Iron ultra-triathlon and Deca Iron ultratriathlon and was comprised between <measure type="interval" ptr="#800bc026-8a8a-44e0-9e55-47df40ac845b">25 and 44 years</measure> for both ultra-triathlon distances. However, the group with the largest participation at <quantifiedObject id="5c68d047-8534-436c-a0be-7d101638c710">the Triple Iron ultra-triathlon</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="interval" ptr="#5c68d047-8534-436c-a0be-7d101638c710">35 to 39 years</measure>) was younger compared to <quantifiedObject id="c9c706db-e58f-4a68-b058-d49f3612708a">the Deca Iron ultra-triathletes</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="interval" ptr="#c9c706db-e58f-4a68-b058-d49f3612708a">40 to 44 years</measure>). We analysed in the present study the age-related decline in Triple Iron ultra-triathletes competing for approximately <measure type="value">2,000 min</measure> compared to Deca Iron ultra-triathletes racing for approximately <measure type="value">12,000 min</measure>. A significant age effect was found for total race time with no difference between the distances. A previous study evidenced that the age-related decline in total performance was less pronounced for <quantifiedObject id="84fe514b-d289-4b2f-bed5-7d5d27994dd0">the Olympic distance triathlon</quantifiedObject> (approximately <measure type="interval" ptr="#84fe514b-d289-4b2f-bed5-7d5d27994dd0">2 to 3 h</measure>) than for <quantifiedObject id="da31d357-2d73-4423-ba7b-fbe4449e3990">the Ironman distance triathlon</quantifiedObject> (approximately<measure type="interval" ptr="#da31d357-2d73-4423-ba7b-fbe4449e3990">9to15h</measure>) [22]. The present data showed that, in ultra-triathlons, the athletes were able to maintain their best performances for <quantifiedObject id="bc88bb40-b070-4589-8aca-fc0b359a9e93">ages comprised</quantifiedObject> between <measure type="interval" ptr="#bc88bb40-b070-4589-8aca-fc0b359a9e93">25 and 44 years</measure>, independent of the distance. In half-marathoners [2], marathoners [2] and short distance triathletes [20][21][22][23], generally athletes in <quantifiedObject id="55d98856-38b3-4b9d-b55e-fab900eaf58d">the age group</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#55d98856-38b3-4b9d-b55e-fab900eaf58d">20 to 30 years</measure> showed the fastest race times compared to athletes in the other age groups. For longer distances such as the Ironman triathlon, athletes in <quantifiedObject id="ffb2a71e-350c-4972-9579-8324ae26051e">the age group</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#ffb2a71e-350c-4972-9579-8324ae26051e">30 to 39 years</measure> were faster compared to athletes in <quantifiedObject id="370a9f42-c595-4ee8-a073-d8e17448faa5">the age group</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#370a9f42-c595-4ee8-a073-d8e17448faa5">20 to 29 years</measure> [25]. Apart from training, also the aspect of pre-race experience seems to be important for a successful finish in an ultra-triathlon. It has been demonstrated that the personal best time in a Triple Iron triathlon, not anthropometry or training volume, was associated with total race time in a Triple Iron triathlon [39]. Furthermore, the number of finished Triple Iron triathlons and the personal best time in a Triple Iron triathlon, but not anthropometry, were also related to Deca Iron ultratriathlon race time [28].</p>
	<p>It would be interesting in future studies to perform a longitudinal observation and to compare the age-related decline from cross-sectional and longitudinal data. A short analysis of the present data showed that <measure type="value" ptr="#acd15f7b-2165-4ef9-b685-4f651cd62fe9">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="acd15f7b-2165-4ef9-b685-4f651cd62fe9">ultratriathletes</quantifiedObject> finished at least <measure type="value" ptr="#f5fcc540-09f0-4a94-9baf-ad4e1e948eb4">eight</measure> times <quantifiedObject id="f5fcc540-09f0-4a94-9baf-ad4e1e948eb4">the Triple Iron</quantifiedObject> ultra-triathlon between <measure type="interval">1992 and 2010</measure>. For these <measure type="value" ptr="#ded3a4ba-794c-453d-a85a-7da944c1ebac">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="ded3a4ba-794c-453d-a85a-7da944c1ebac">ultra-triathletes</quantifiedObject>, their total performances did not significantly change across the ages (Figure 2). These findings suggest that some exceptional ultra-triathletes are able to perform at the same level of performance during an <measure type="interval">8-(subject A) to 16-year</measure> (subject D) period.</p>
	<p>Tanaka and Seals [4] demonstrated that the changes in endurance perfo<quantifiedObject id="97432222-93db-469e-97f3-8f29ddd3efb1">rmanc</quantifiedObject>e with aging were attributed to reductions in VO 2 max and the decline in lactate threshold. Findings for competitive long-distance runners indicated that the decline in running times parallel the age-related reductions in VO 2 max and in lactate threshold [15]. For runners, mean VO 2 max declined from <measure type="value" ptr="#97432222-93db-469e-97f3-8f29ddd3efb1">71.4 ml Á min −1 Á kg −1</measure> in youth to <measure type="value" ptr="#141d5b33-c975-4482-ac8b-8a4f80c74513">41.8 ml Á min −1 Á kg −1</measure> at <quantifiedObject id="d5c84972-7ff3-43b9-a2d1-dcd06f897076">a mean age of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#d5c84972-7ff3-43b9-a2d1-dcd06f897076">56.6 years</measure> [44]. The decrease in an ultra-endurance performance may be attributed to an age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass. A large component of lost independence with increasing age is weakness due to a loss of lean muscle mass. Muscle power is lost at a greater rate than is endurance capacity with <measure type="value">3.5%</measure> versus <measure type="value" ptr="#b77624c9-905b-4181-b73f-b4765f325905">1.8%</measure> per year, respectively [6]. The agerelated loss of muscle mass is primarily due to a decrease in the size of type II (fast-twitch) muscle fibres and a change in the proportions of fibre types [45,46]. There is an increase in the proportion of type II fibres, which may adapt to high endurance demands [47].</p>
	<p>The first limitation of this cross-sectional study is the problem arising from the data collection. Firstly, it is not sure at <measure type="value">100%</measure> that there are no data errors (age, race time) when taking them from the race websites and the official rankings. Secondly, we cannot assure that the age-related performance decline is not at least partly due to non-participation of older athletes or simply to a selfchosen lower intensity of older athletes. In addition, race participants may represent selected sub-groups of the total population of ultra-triathletes, e.g. some potential participants may have been prevented from participating due to many reasons.</p>
	<p>It was not possible to collect other performance-related factors such as characteristics of training [36,37,39], anthropometry [27,29,<measure type="list">34,35</measure>,39] and previous experience [28,37,38]. Thus, these factors had to be ignored in this study. In addition, we have not included environmental conditions. It has been shown that an ultra-performance [74,75] progressively slows down when the ambient temperature increases [59,60].</p>
	<p>This cross sectional study found that the magnitudes of age-related declines in ultra-triathlon performance for Triple Iro<quantifiedObject id="32298ee5-d600-481b-9e66-916c2ade9e80">n a</quantifiedObject>nd Deca Iron triathlon are quite similar. For both Triple Iron and the Deca Iron ultra-triathletes, the fastest race times were achieved between <measure type="interval" ptr="#32298ee5-d600-481b-9e66-916c2ade9e80">25 and 44 years</measure> of age, although participants at the Triple Iron triathlon were on average younger compared to the Deca Iron triathlon. Further studies should investigate the motivation and training of ultra-triathletes to gain better insights in ultra-triathlon performance.</p>

During this period, both the Triple Iron triathlons in Lensahn, Germany and the Deca Iron triathlons in Monterrey, Mexico were held regularly. The data set from this study was obtained from the race websites www.triathlonlensahn.de for the Triple Iron triathlon Germany in Lensahn, www.multisport.com.mx for the Deca Iron triathlon in Monterrey, Mexico and from the race directors involved.</p>
	<p>The Triple Iron ultra-triathlon in Germany took place in Lensahn, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, and was comprised of <measure type="value" ptr="#a80b672b-5885-4e09-8a0a-c7350b36bf3d">11.6-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a80b672b-5885-4e09-8a0a-c7350b36bf3d">swimming</quantifiedObject>, <measure type="value" ptr="#0c83da09-b7db-4a83-8274-8cb0a662605a">540-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="0c83da09-b7db-4a83-8274-8cb0a662605a">cycling and</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#3c969188-309f-45d2-b275-ae2597656d68">126.6-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="3c969188-309f-45d2-b275-ae2597656d68">running</quantifiedObject>.

The cycling course was nearly free of road traffic, and the run course was completely free of traffic and illuminated during the night. All the athletes had their own support crew to provide nutrition and changes of clothes or equipment. The athletes had to arrive at the finish line within <measure type="value" ptr="#02dd78a7-c03d-4962-a07a-174adcaff953">58 h</measure> of the race start. The Deca Iron ultra-triathlon took place in Monterrey, Mexico.

After the cycling, the athletes changed and went directly to the run course which was on the same track but in the opposite direction. Drafting in the cycle section was strictly prohibited and controlled by the race director. The laps on both the cycle and run courses were counted electronically using a microchip system. The athletes can be helped by their own support crew for nutrition and changes of equipment and clothes. During the whole race, accommodation is offered in the Sports Village inside the park, about <measure type="value">250 m</measure> away from the race site. The athletes and their support crews have a room with bed, toilet and shower. For nutrition, the organiser offered a variety of food in a restaurant, at the race site, that was open <measure type="value">24 h</measure> a day.</p>
	<p>In each race year, the age of the winner and the mean age of the male finishers were analysed at both the Triple Iron ultra-triathlons and the Deca <quantifiedObject id="c21f1d2a-0916-4209-a597-81101e4c8b99">Iron ultra-triathlons from</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#c21f1d2a-0916-4209-a597-81101e4c8b99">1992 to 2010</measure>.</p>
	<p>In order to analyse the age-related changes in swimming, cycling, running and the total race performances, we pooled the data from <measure type="interval" ptr="#f7720cd6-96fd-4d73-a878-66c1960372ab">1992 to 2010</measure> for <quantifiedObject id="f7720cd6-96fd-4d73-a878-66c1960372ab">both distances</quantifiedObject>.

	<p>Data are reported as means ± standard deviations (±SD) in the text and the figures. Linear regressions were used for estimating the changes in the age of winners and the mean age of finishers per year. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between the age and the years. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the ages of the Triple and the Deca Iron ultratriathlon winners and the mean ages of the finishers. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the swimming, cycling, running and total race times between the different age groups for both distances. Tukey's post hoc analyses were used to test differences within the ANOVA when appropriate.
