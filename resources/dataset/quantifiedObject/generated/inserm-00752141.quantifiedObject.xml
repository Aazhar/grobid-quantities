	<p>Background: The age-related decline in performance has been investigated in swimmers, runners and triathletes. No study has investigated the age-related performance decline in ultra-triathletes. The purpose of this study was to analyse the age-related declines in swimming, cycling, running and overall race time for both Triple Iron ultra-triathlon (<measure type="value" ptr="#8cf06645-5c73-4605-9993-7c1c00e38494" pos="left">11.4-km</measure> swimming, 540-km <quantifiedObject id="8cf06645-5c73-4605-9993-7c1c00e38494">cycling and</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#1f129984-3d44-4bc4-b62c-0fbae45e46ab" pos="left">126.6-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="1f129984-3d44-4bc4-b62c-0fbae45e46ab">running</quantifiedObject>) and Deca Iron ultra-triathlon (<measure type="value" ptr="#74ced4f7-d8bf-4eb8-a305-0b56f144240e" pos="left">38-km</measure> swimming, 1,800-km <quantifiedObject id="74ced4f7-d8bf-4eb8-a305-0b56f144240e">cycling and</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#62ad1f59-f8da-449c-af39-ebd378e636bf" pos="left">420-km</measure> <quantifiedObject id="62ad1f59-f8da-449c-af39-ebd378e636bf">running</quantifiedObject>).</p>

However, with increasing age, the endurance performance decreases.

	<p>Considering the age-related decline in male ultraendurance athletes, Hoffman investigated ultra-marathoners competing over <measure type="value">161 kilometres</measure> [7][8][9].

The <measure type="interval">30-to 39-year</measure>-old males showed the fastest races times, with athletes in younger and older age groups being slower. The <measure type="interval">40-to 49-year</measure> age group was approximately <measure type="value">4.0%</measure> slower than the <measure type="interval">30 to 39 years</measure> one [8].

Both the moderate decline in running performance and the large number of successful master athletes suggest that master athletes are able to maintain a high degree of physiological performance with increasing age [17]. For Ironman triathletes, both an increase in participation and an improvement in performance in master athletes have recently been reported [18,19].</p>

	<p>Regarding the performance in a triathlon, the association of different characteristics in physiology [30][31][32][33], anthropometry [34][35][36][37], training [34,35,38] and <quantifiedObject id="835f178b-d9aa-4fe3-ae22-f5313607a0f0">previous experience</quantifiedObject> [28,36,<measure type="list" ptr="#835f178b-d9aa-4fe3-ae22-f5313607a0f0" pos="right">37</measure>,39,40] with race time has been investigated. Apart from these characteristics, an agerelated decline has been described for Olympic distance triathletes [20][21][22][23] as well as for Ironman triathletes [22,25]. It seems that the length of an endurance performance has an influence of the age-related performance decline. In short distance triathletes, a significant decline in performance starts at <quantifiedObject id="132caeb1-893b-404d-8f58-a230d6f4fe81">the age of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#132caeb1-893b-404d-8f58-a230d6f4fe81" pos="right">45 to 50 years</measure> [20,23].

	<p>These are the performances of the different age groups at the Deca Iron triathlon (Data were pooled from <measure type="interval">1992 to 2010</measure> The aim of this study was to analyse the age-related declines in swimming, cycling, running and total performances in male Triple and Deca Iron ultra-triathletes.

	<p>A main interesting finding was that the age-related decline occurred later in swimming and cycling compared to<quantifiedObject id="84d609ea-4023-4749-9d2d-050ce0c1969a"> running at t</quantifiedObject>he Deca Iron ultra-triathlon distance. Previous studies suggested that the age-related decline in triathlon performance was specific to the discipline, with cycling showing fewer declines in performance with age than running in both short distance and Ironman triathletes [20,22]. The present results showed that the swimming and cycling performances were maintained until the age of <measure type="interval" ptr="#84d609ea-4023-4749-9d2d-050ce0c1969a" pos="right">54</measure> for the Deca Iron ultra-triathletes but only until <quantifiedObject id="ecb30bc3-c718-4407-ae5f-8be9687159c9">the age of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#ecb30bc3-c718-4407-ae5f-8be9687159c9" pos="right">44</measure> for the Triple Iron ultra-triathletes.

[41] analysed the performance of <measure type="value" ptr="#c3928d68-61c6-4f1d-835b-54cf935febae" pos="left">73</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c3928d68-61c6-4f1d-835b-54cf935febae">triathletes</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#8bca4548-e192-46b0-acd5-73975fd0628c" pos="left">68</measure> <quantifiedObject id="8bca4548-e192-46b0-acd5-73975fd0628c">men and</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#614c97a3-f210-458a-9eaf-924b39cab4b5" pos="left">5</measure> <quantifiedObject id="614c97a3-f210-458a-9eaf-924b39cab4b5">women</quantifiedObject>) who finished a Double Iron ultratriathlon, a Triple Iron ultra-triathlon and a Deca Iron ultra-triathlon. The contribution of swimming to overall ultra-triathlon performance was lower than for cycling and running. Running performance was more important to overall performance for Double Iron ultra-triathlon and Triple Iron ultra-triathlon compared to Deca Iron ultra-triathlon. The Double Iron ultra-triathlon and Triple Iron ultra-triathlon performances were significantly correlated to Deca Iron ultra-triathlon performances for swimming and cycling, but not for running.</p>
	<p>Since the age-related performance started to decline later in an Ironman distance triathlon than in an Olympic distance triathlon, we hypothesised that the agerelated decline in performance would o<quantifiedObject id="754ae4d2-caf4-4c67-95a6-a80f941dea00">ccur later for Deca Iron ultra</quantifiedObject>-triathletes than for Triple Iron ultra- triathletes and the fastest performance in a Deca Iron ultra-triathlon would be achieved at a higher age than in a Triple Iron ultra-triathlon. In contrast to our hypothesis, the age of the best overall performance did not differ between Triple Iron ultra-triathlon and Deca Iron ultratriathlon and was comprised between <measure type="interval" ptr="#754ae4d2-caf4-4c67-95a6-a80f941dea00" pos="right">25 and 44 years</measure> for both ultra-triathlon distances. However, the group with the largest participation at <quantifiedObject id="b2e6d47e-b21c-4cd4-b0b6-ffee872b9392">the Triple Iron ultra-triathlon</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="interval" ptr="#b2e6d47e-b21c-4cd4-b0b6-ffee872b9392" pos="right">35 to 39 years</measure>) was younger compared to <quantifiedObject id="81e59342-7cc7-42f6-9e3b-222322eb3a3a">the Deca Iron ultra-triathletes</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="interval" ptr="#81e59342-7cc7-42f6-9e3b-222322eb3a3a" pos="right">40 to 44 years</measure>). We analysed in the present study the age-related decline in Triple Iron ultra-triathletes competing for approximately <measure type="value">2,000 min</measure> compared to Deca Iron ultra-triathletes racing for approximately <measure type="value">12,000 min</measure>. A significant age effect was found for total race time with no difference between the distances. A previous study evidenced that the age-related decline in total performance was less pronounced for <quantifiedObject id="001f6680-e687-4811-b7b0-9f12752c77d4">the Olympic distance triathlon</quantifiedObject> (approximately <measure type="interval" ptr="#001f6680-e687-4811-b7b0-9f12752c77d4" pos="right">2 to 3 h</measure>) than for <quantifiedObject id="17e380bd-9d90-4911-bf0a-f9a40284890f">the Ironman distance triathlon</quantifiedObject> (approximately<measure type="interval" ptr="#17e380bd-9d90-4911-bf0a-f9a40284890f" pos="right">9to15h</measure>) [22]. The present data showed that, in ultra-triathlons, the athletes were able to maintain their best performances for <quantifiedObject id="77b6c453-ee6f-436b-b7db-4f9bb6400dfb">ages comprised</quantifiedObject> between <measure type="interval" ptr="#77b6c453-ee6f-436b-b7db-4f9bb6400dfb" pos="right">25 and 44 years</measure>, independent of the distance. In half-marathoners [2], marathoners [2] and short distance triathletes [20][21][22][23], generally athletes in <quantifiedObject id="93d07560-feee-4b91-ac28-3df6cc44571b">the age group</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#93d07560-feee-4b91-ac28-3df6cc44571b" pos="right">20 to 30 years</measure> showed the fastest race times compared to athletes in the other age groups. For longer distances such as the Ironman triathlon, athletes in <quantifiedObject id="023805af-113e-4a8f-af1b-dccda3e49f19">the age group</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#023805af-113e-4a8f-af1b-dccda3e49f19" pos="right">30 to 39 years</measure> were faster compared to athletes in <quantifiedObject id="e1662e36-d544-4337-92c9-4f6297fb67f5">the age group</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#e1662e36-d544-4337-92c9-4f6297fb67f5" pos="right">20 to 29 years</measure> [25]. Apart from training, also the aspect of pre-race experience seems to be important for a successful finish in an ultra-triathlon. It has been demonstrated that the personal best time in a Triple Iron triathlon, not anthropometry or training volume, was associated with total race time in a Triple Iron triathlon [39]. Furthermore, the number of finished Triple Iron triathlons and the personal best time in a Triple Iron triathlon, but not anthropometry, were also related to Deca Iron ultratriathlon race time [28].</p>
	<p>It would be interesting in future studies to perform a longitudinal observation and to compare the age-related decline from cross-sectional and longitudinal data. A short analysis of the present data showed that <measure type="value" ptr="#372efa33-a70a-41fa-a67c-2eda900e5ffd" pos="left">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="372efa33-a70a-41fa-a67c-2eda900e5ffd">ultratriathletes</quantifiedObject> finished at least <measure type="value" ptr="#5183df66-123b-4684-b853-b9eac709ac57" pos="left">eight</measure> times <quantifiedObject id="5183df66-123b-4684-b853-b9eac709ac57">the Triple Iron</quantifiedObject> ultra-triathlon between <measure type="interval">1992 and 2010</measure>. For these <measure type="value" ptr="#130f4475-bfe8-4a76-ba43-f6403f83043f" pos="left">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="130f4475-bfe8-4a76-ba43-f6403f83043f">ultra-triathletes</quantifiedObject>, their total performances did not significantly change across the ages (Figure 2). These findings suggest that some exceptional ultra-triathletes are able to perform at the same level of performance during an <measure type="interval">8-(subject A) to 16-year</measure> (subject D) period.</p>
	<p>Tanaka and Seals [4] demonstrated that the changes in endurance perfo<quantifiedObject id="49e6655d-7ef0-4e62-b3d0-2fb272e24b32">rmanc</quantifiedObject>e with aging were attributed to reductions in VO 2 max and the decline in lactate threshold. Findings for competitive long-distance runners indicated that the decline in running times parallel the age-related reductions in VO 2 max and in lactate threshold [15]. For runners, mean VO 2 max declined from <measure type="value" ptr="#49e6655d-7ef0-4e62-b3d0-2fb272e24b32" pos="right">71.4 ml Á min −1 Á kg −1</measure> in youth to <measure type="value" ptr="#177ad947-4483-4a1e-84dd-eed38e061a04" pos="right">41.8 ml Á min −1 Á kg −1</measure> at <quantifiedObject id="81db6614-972e-4006-8338-a9b726a589ef">a mean age of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#81db6614-972e-4006-8338-a9b726a589ef" pos="right">56.6 years</measure> [44]. The decrease in an ultra-endurance performance may be attributed to an age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass. A large component of lost independence with increasing age is weakness due to a loss of lean muscle mass. Muscle power is lost at a greater rate than is endurance capacity with <measure type="value">3.5%</measure> versus <measure type="value" ptr="#555d4253-efe2-4152-9c19-694a9bd2c933" pos="right">1.8%</measure> per year, respectively [6]. The agerelated loss of muscle mass is primarily due to a decrease in the size of type II (fast-twitch) muscle fibres and a change in the proportions of fibre types [45,46]. There is an increase in the proportion of type II fibres, which may adapt to high endurance demands [47].</p>
	<p>The first limitation of this cross-sectional study is the problem arising from the data collection. Firstly, it is not sure at <measure type="value">100%</measure> that there are no data errors (age, race time) when taking them from the race websites and the official rankings. Secondly, we cannot assure that the age-related performance decline is not at least partly due to non-participation of older athletes or simply to a selfchosen lower intensity of older athletes. In addition, race participants may represent selected sub-groups of the total population of ultra-triathletes, e.g. some potential participants may have been prevented from participating due to many reasons.</p>
	<p>It was not possible to collect other performance-related factors such as characteristics of training [36,37,39], anthropometry [27,29,<measure type="list">3435</measure>,,39] and previous experience [28,37,38]. Thus, these factors had to be ignored in this study. In addition, we have not included environmental conditions. It has been shown that an ultra-performance [74,75] progressively slows down when the ambient temperature increases [59,60].</p>
	<p>This cross sectional study found that the magnitudes of age-related declines in ultra-triathlon performance for Triple Iro<quantifiedObject id="4dd94d18-58a0-4c58-ab36-3c04152a4d66">n a</quantifiedObject>nd Deca Iron triathlon are quite similar. For both Triple Iron and the Deca Iron ultra-triathletes, the fastest race times were achieved between <measure type="interval" ptr="#4dd94d18-58a0-4c58-ab36-3c04152a4d66" pos="right">25 and 44 years</measure> of age, although participants at the Triple Iron triathlon were on average younger compared to the Deca Iron triathlon. Further studies should investigate the motivation and training of ultra-triathletes to gain better insights in ultra-triathlon performance.</p>
