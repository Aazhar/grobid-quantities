Apart from these characteristics, an agerelated decline has been described for Olympic distance triathletes [20][21][22][23] as well as for Ironman triathletes [22,25].

Previous studies suggested that the age-related decline in triathlon performance was specific to the discipline, with cycling showing fewer declines in performance with age than running in both short distance and Ironman triathletes [20,22].

A potential explanation for this finding could be pre-race experience. It has been shown that previous experience was a strong predictor for a successful finish in an ultra-triathlon [28,39].

The Double Iron ultra-triathlon and Triple Iron ultra-triathlon performances were significantly correlated to Deca Iron ultra-triathlon performances for swimming and cycling, but not for running.</p><p>Since the age-related performance started to decline later in an Ironman distance triathlon than in an Olympic distance triathlon, we hypothesised that the agerelated decline in performance would o<quantifiedObject id="7d26cab2-412b-47fa-be7b-017404d622ce">ccur later for Deca Iron ultra</quantifiedObject>-triathletes than for Triple Iron ultra- triathletes and the fastest performance in a Deca Iron ultra-triathlon would be achieved at a higher age than in a Triple Iron ultra-triathlon. In contrast to our hypothesis, the age of the best overall performance did not differ between Triple Iron ultra-triathlon and Deca Iron ultratriathlon and was comprised between <measure type="interval" ptr="#7d26cab2-412b-47fa-be7b-017404d622ce">25 and 44 years</measure> for both ultra-triathlon distances.

We analysed in the present study the age-related decline in Triple Iron ultra-triathletes competing for approximately <measure type="value">2,000 min</measure> compared to Deca Iron ultra-triathletes racing for approximately <measure type="value">12,000 min</measure>. A significant age effect was found for total race time with no difference between the distances. A previous study evidenced that the age-related decline in total performance was less pronounced for <quantifiedObject id="b81d4cdb-1c8a-4bad-9a95-146e5bb69a45">the Olympic distance triathlon</quantifiedObject> (approximately <measure type="interval" ptr="#b81d4cdb-1c8a-4bad-9a95-146e5bb69a45">2 to 3 h</measure>) than for <quantifiedObject id="76785aba-86e4-4aa3-9f3b-b13f87db27bf">the Ironman distance triathlon</quantifiedObject> (approximately<measure type="interval" ptr="#76785aba-86e4-4aa3-9f3b-b13f87db27bf">9to15h</measure>) [22]. The present data showed that, in ultra-triathlons, the athletes were able to maintain their best performances for <quantifiedObject id="f842453d-fc76-43d8-9f9b-6966619e734d">ages comprised</quantifiedObject> between <measure type="interval" ptr="#f842453d-fc76-43d8-9f9b-6966619e734d">25 and 44 years</measure>, independent of the distance. In half-marathoners [2], marathoners [2] and short distance triathletes [20][21][22][23], generally athletes in <quantifiedObject id="b400e258-420d-49bf-a8a7-592bb64779da">the age group</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#b400e258-420d-49bf-a8a7-592bb64779da">20 to 30 years</measure> showed the fastest race times compared to athletes in the other age groups. For longer distances such as the Ironman triathlon, athletes in <quantifiedObject id="293a33ff-8903-44f8-b06f-4209fe287927">the age group</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#293a33ff-8903-44f8-b06f-4209fe287927">30 to 39 years</measure> were faster compared to athletes in <quantifiedObject id="3a94dd03-c6a7-4177-aa0a-de57bb403da1">the age group</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#3a94dd03-c6a7-4177-aa0a-de57bb403da1">20 to 29 years</measure> [25]. Apart from training, also the aspect of pre-race experience seems to be important for a successful finish in an ultra-triathlon. It has been demonstrated that the personal best time in a Triple Iron triathlon, not anthropometry or training volume, was associated with total race time in a Triple Iron triathlon [39]. Furthermore, the number of finished Triple Iron triathlons and the personal best time in a Triple Iron triathlon, but not anthropometry, were also related to Deca Iron ultratriathlon race time [28].</p><p>It would be interesting in future studies to perform a longitudinal observation and to compare the age-related decline from cross-sectional and longitudinal data. A short analysis of the present data showed that <measure type="value" ptr="#c9e2a46c-95ef-4e0f-b9ff-25641553f95b">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c9e2a46c-95ef-4e0f-b9ff-25641553f95b">ultratriathletes</quantifiedObject> finished at least <measure type="value" ptr="#fa55b62b-c341-41f3-ac06-38c407ca565d">eight</measure> times <quantifiedObject id="fa55b62b-c341-41f3-ac06-38c407ca565d">the Triple Iron</quantifiedObject> ultra-triathlon between <measure type="interval">1992 and 2010</measure>.

These findings suggest that some exceptional ultra-triathletes are able to perform at the same level of performance during an <measure type="interval">8-(subject A) to 16-year</measure> (subject D) period.</p><p>Tanaka and Seals [4] demonstrated that the changes in endurance perfo<quantifiedObject id="f65df746-b29d-4daa-9745-cbebad12c751">rmanc</quantifiedObject>e with aging were attributed to reductions in VO 2 max and the decline in lactate threshold. Findings for competitive long-distance runners indicated that the decline in running times parallel the age-related reductions in VO 2 max and in lactate threshold [15]. For runners, mean VO 2 max declined from <measure type="value" ptr="#f65df746-b29d-4daa-9745-cbebad12c751">71.4 ml Á min −1 Á kg −1</measure> in youth to <measure type="value" ptr="#1f6fdc3e-68a8-453a-bb4e-5e5ae78a460a">41.8 ml Á min −1 Á kg −1</measure> at <quantifiedObject id="f615265a-da8b-4b70-82c5-85cbbc4b018d">a mean age of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#f615265a-da8b-4b70-82c5-85cbbc4b018d">56.6 years</measure> [44]. The decrease in an ultra-endurance performance may be attributed to an age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass. A large component of lost independence with increasing age is weakness due to a loss of lean muscle mass. Muscle power is lost at a greater rate than is endurance capacity with <measure type="value">3.5%</measure> versus <measure type="value" ptr="#a9a9102b-d2a2-4f97-bd6a-df67ee76f04c">1.8%</measure> per year, respectively [6]. The agerelated loss of muscle mass is primarily due to a decrease in the size of type II (fast-twitch) muscle fibres and a change in the proportions of fibre types [45,46]. There is an increase in the proportion of type II fibres, which may adapt to high endurance demands [47].</p><p>The first limitation of this cross-sectional study is the problem arising from the data collection. Firstly, it is not sure at <measure type="value">100%</measure> that there are no data errors (age, race time) when taking them from the race websites and the official rankings. Secondly, we cannot assure that the age-related performance decline is not at least partly due to non-participation of older athletes or simply to a selfchosen lower intensity of older athletes. In addition, race participants may represent selected sub-groups of the total population of ultra-triathletes, e.g. some potential participants may have been prevented from participating due to many reasons.</p><p>It was not possible to collect other performance-related factors such as characteristics of training [36,37,39], anthropometry [27,29,<measure type="list">3435</measure>,,39] and previous experience [28,37,38]. Thus, these factors had to be ignored in this study. In addition, we have not included environmental conditions. It has been shown that an ultra-performance [74,75] progressively slows down when the ambient temperature increases [59,60].</p><p>This cross sectional study found that the magnitudes of age-related declines in ultra-triathlon performance for Triple Iro<quantifiedObject id="7999d696-d351-4fd0-adf9-271ab52baa09">n a</quantifiedObject>nd Deca Iron triathlon are quite similar. For both Triple Iron and the Deca Iron ultra-triathletes, the fastest race times were achieved between <measure type="interval" ptr="#7999d696-d351-4fd0-adf9-271ab52baa09">25 and 44 years</measure> of age, although participants at the Triple Iron triathlon were on average younger compared to the Deca Iron triathlon. Further studies should investigate the motivation and training of ultra-triathletes to gain better insights in ultra-triathlon performance.</p><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of St. Gallen, Switzerland, with a waiver for the requirement of an informed consent given by the subjects since the study involved the analysis of publicly available data.
