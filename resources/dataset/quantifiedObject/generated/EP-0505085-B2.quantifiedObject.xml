	<p>[0028] Carbon is an element necessary for improving hardenability, necessary for strength. If less than 0.15% is present, insufficient hardenability is achieved and soft ferrite structure tends to form around the steel article so that insufficient tensile strength and yield strength are achieved. With more than <measure type="value" ptr="#039705c0-9786-442c-a597-cf8dc74d1067">0.3</measure><quantifiedObject id="039705c0-9786-442c-a597-cf8dc74d1067">%</quantifiedObject>, toughness is reduced. Hence the carbon content is <measure type="value">0.15</measure> to <measure type="value">0.3%</measure>, or preferably <measure type="interval">0.20</measure> to <measure type="value">0.28%</measure>.</p>
	<p>[0029] Conventionally, these elements have been added as deoxidizers. However, new steel-making technology such as the carbon deoxidising process using vacuum ladle refining, and the electroslag re-melting process, have obviated the need for such elements in making a sound article. To prevent brittleness due to tempering, the quantities of silicon and manganese should be kept low. The silicon content is less than <measure type="interval">0.05%</measure>, and that of manganese less than <measure type="interval">0.5%</measure>, more preferably less than <measure type="interval" ptr="#02e66f65-8672-4d66-a5ac-2f5fee197ccf">0.25%0.2</measure>, and most preferably less than <quantifiedObject id="02e66f65-8672-4d66-a5ac-2f5fee197ccf">%</quantifiedObject>.

However it is usually desirable to add some manganese; the quantity should be at least <measure type="value">0.05%</measure>(not claimed) or preferably at least <measure type="value">0.1%</measure> (according to the invention).</p>
	<p>[0030] Nickel is essential for improving hardenability and toughness. With less than <measure type="interval">3.0%5</measure>, there is insufficient toughness. If a large amount is used, over %, harmful residual austenite structure appears so that the desired uniform tempered bainite is not achieved. Therefore at least <measure type="interval">3.5% is used. Conversely, the amount should be less than 5%</measure> and preferably less than <measure type="interval">4.5%</measure>.</p>
	<p>[0031] Chromium has a remarkable effect in improving hardenability and toughness. It also improves the resistance to corrosion.

	<p>[0032] Molybdenum precipitates fine carbide in the crystal grain during tempering, intensifying tensile strength and yield strength by a carbide dispersion strengthening action. It also acts to restrict the segregation of impurities at the crystal grain boundary. It can prevent brittleness due to tempering. At least <measure type="value">0.1%</measure> is required to secure these effects. Over <measure type="value">1.0%</measure>, however, the effects tend to be saturated. The preferred range is <measure type="interval">0.25 to 0.6%</measure>, more preferably <measure type="interval">0.35</measure> to <measure type="value">0.45%</measure>. However, Mo may to some extent be substituted by W: see below.</p>
	<p>[0033] Like Mo, V precipitates fine carbide with the same desirable effects. To achieve the effects, at least <measure type="value">0.03%</measure> should be used, preferably at least <measure type="value">0.05%</measure> and more preferably at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#911fb2da-a0ce-46a8-b769-a5e0c651baa0">0.1</measure><quantifiedObject id="911fb2da-a0ce-46a8-b769-a5e0c651baa0">%</quantifiedObject>.

	<p>[0034] We have found that excessive quantities of aluminium reduce toughness and desirable magnetic properties. A complete absence of Al completely reduces strength, so at least <measure type="value">0.0005%</measure> should be used in making the steel. However, the quantity should be kept low so that toughness and magnetic characteristics are good. Not more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#e6131f66-b572-4c7c-a36b-da8d1a968ff9">0.006</measure><quantifiedObject id="e6131f66-b572-4c7c-a36b-da8d1a968ff9">% and</quantifiedObject> more preferably not more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#f987e4ab-e4e8-4935-b1fa-cbdf9146e9f9">0.005</measure><quantifiedObject id="f987e4ab-e4e8-4935-b1fa-cbdf9146e9f9">%</quantifiedObject>, should be used.</p>
	<p>[0036] It is usual for most or all of these to be present as impurities. However they reduce toughness and magnetic characteristics. The total quantity is desirably less than <measure type="interval">0.03%</measure>, more preferably less than <measure type="interval">0.025%</measure>. It is difficult to eliminate the elements entirely, but it is particularly desirable to get the total down to less than <measure type="interval">0.01%</measure>.</p>
	<p>[0037] We have also found a correlation between the total amount of these impurities, and the amount of Si, as regards the magnetic properties of the steel. A product of the proportion of Si and a value X (the sum of the concentrations of the <measure type="value" ptr="#328ddb85-5db4-413f-95e9-198f2de7ffa9">five</measure> above-<quantifiedObject id="328ddb85-5db4-413f-95e9-198f2de7ffa9">identified impurities</quantifiedObject>) is preferably less than <measure type="interval" ptr="#cd6145d3-0146-4703-8500-be1f64c344ae">0.003</measure>, more preferably less than <measure type="interval" ptr="#e867d9cc-e139-469e-a9b8-a8784eac8efb">0.0015</measure>.</p>
	<p>[0038] The ratio of these components is related to tensile strength. The ratio should usually be less than <measure type="interval">2.3</measure>, preferably less than <measure type="interval" ptr="#a088f001-a66b-46bb-b576-483bcbbe0d5b">2.1</measure> and more preferably less than <measure type="interval">2.051.2</measure>. The preferred range is  to <measure type="interval">2.051.4</measure>, the more preferred range is  to <measure type="interval">2.053%</measure>. The Ni content is more than .</p>
	<p>[0039] One or more Group IIa elements (Be, Mg, Ca) and/or <measure type="list" ptr="#1ea787f8-20de-4c58-ae99-066c7279b927">one</measure> or more <quantifiedObject id="1ea787f8-20de-4c58-ae99-066c7279b927">Group IIIa elements (Sc, Y, Lanthanides</quantifiedObject>) may be incorporated, in <quantifiedObject id="6fcc6a10-4afe-439c-8781-d2b5708bf8de">an amount</quantifiedObject> up to <measure type="value" ptr="#6fcc6a10-4afe-439c-8781-d2b5708bf8de">0.1%</measure>. These elements have a strong deoxidising effect and can improve toughness and magnetic characteristics. A preferred quantity is <measure type="value">0.001</measure> to <measure type="value">0.05%</measure>. The non-radioactive elements are preferable from the point of view of handling.</p>
	<p>[0040] One or more of Ti, Zr, Hf, Nd, Ta and W may be incorporated, in <quantifiedObject id="df3eba5f-40ce-41f0-93ec-c6f329a80c25">amounts</quantifiedObject> less than <measure type="interval" ptr="#df3eba5f-40ce-41f0-93ec-c6f329a80c25">0.2%</measure> by weight, consistent with increasing strength without reducing toughness. A preferred quantity is <measure type="value">0.02</measure> to <measure type="value">0.1%</measure>. W acts in the same way as Mo, mentioned above, so W can be substituted for part of Mo.</p>
	<p>[0041] Thus, the quantity of Mo + W may be <measure type="interval">0.1 to 1.0%</measure>. The quantity of W is preferably not more than half the total quantity. Mo must be present, but W is optional.</p>
	<p>[0042] The steel should have tempered bainite structure, and should contain less than <measure type="interval">5%</measure> ferrite. A uniform, overall structure of bainite is preferred for strength and toughness.</p>
	<p>[0044] To reduce silicon considerably, molten metal is obtained by vacuum ladle refining or electroslag re-melting after melting in air. The molten metal is cast in a mould, and hot forged to the desired shape. Subsequently, it is quenched at from <measure type="interval">800 to 900°C</measure> and then tempered at <measure type="interval" ptr="#8ad39aa8-3663-4c78-9194-5a1bba41262b">525 to 650°C</measure> for at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#6aba7ad4-7033-40c1-8fbe-a6546ce05f09">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="6aba7ad4-7033-40c1-8fbe-a6546ce05f09">hours</quantifiedObject>. The quenching temperature is desirably <measure type="interval">30 to 70°C</measure> higher than the point Ac 3 , most preferably about <measure type="value">50°C</measure> higher. Tempering increases toughness. The preferred temperature is <measure type="interval">540 to 625°C</measure>, preferably for <measure type="interval">10 to 80 hours</measure>. After tempering, the final shape is formed by cutting. Cutting generates internal stresses, so stress relief annealing is performed at a temperature below the tempering temperature. Furthermore, homogenising annealing is done at <quantifiedObject id="41374e5b-7803-4f08-a4c9-6ffa6ac557df">a temperature about</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#41374e5b-7803-4f08-a4c9-6ffa6ac557df">50°C</measure> higher than the quenching temperature, followed by slow cooling.</p>
	<p>[0045] At the time of quenching, the cooling speed is preferably <measure type="interval">50 to 300°C per</measure> hour at the centre of a rotor shaft. This enables formation of bainite structure overall.</p>
	<p>[0046] As mentioned, the silicon quantity can be set in <quantifiedObject id="823c52cc-4bcb-48b4-af65-961e3b314b48">the range</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#823c52cc-4bcb-48b4-af65-961e3b314b48">0.1 to 0.3%</measure>, provided that the aluminium quantity is kept below <measure type="interval">0.01%</measure>. With higher silicon, good characteristics can also be achieved provided that <quantifiedObject id="f57b403b-b49f-4d5e-bc49-07023e318851">the total quantity of</quantifiedObject> P, S, Sn, Sb and As is kept low, desirably less than <measure type="interval" ptr="#f57b403b-b49f-4d5e-bc49-07023e318851">0.025%</measure>. The skilled man knows how to reduce the quantities of the latter, although the present importance of this has not previously been disclosed.</p>
	<p>[0047] Using the previously mentioned alloy steel enables the rotor shaft for electric machines to be made compact by setting the diameter of the body in which a coil is embedded more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#492ffc5f-b288-404e-a53d-7b378d7f6cdf">1</measure><quantifiedObject id="492ffc5f-b288-404e-a53d-7b378d7f6cdf">m</quantifiedObject> and the length of <quantifiedObject id="13d27271-9bc7-428d-85e4-158940ff0c7f">the body</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#13d27271-9bc7-428d-85e4-158940ff0c7f">5.5 to 6.5</measure> times the diameter. The ratio of less than <measure type="interval">5.5</measure> or over <measure type="value" ptr="#69a8afc8-2b09-4535-b3a5-93780ea07cab">6.5</measure> is not desirable from the viewpoint of vibration. Particularly <measure type="interval">5.6</measure> to <measure type="value">6.0</measure> is desirable.</p>
	<p>[0048] Although the diameter of the body needs to be enlarged together with the capacity of the generator, it should EP <measure type="value">0 505 085</measure> B2 [0049] Further, the diameter of the body D (m) should be set according to rotation speed (rpm), so that the value of (D 2 x R 2 ) is more than <measure type="interval">1.0 x 10 7</measure> . Particularly, the upper limit is desired to be <measure type="value">3.0 x 10 7</measure> or more preferably <measure type="interval">1.5</measure> to 2.2 x <measure type="list">10 7</measure> and most preferably <measure type="interval">1.8</measure> to <measure type="value">2.0 x 10 7</measure> .</p>
	<p>[0050] Although a larger capacity/output generator or motor tends to be larger, using high strength alloy steel as mentioned above enables a compact apparatus, particularly so that the capacity per floor area is <measure type="value">0.08</measure> to <measure type="value">0.12m</measure> 2 per 1 MVA of the capacity. Consequently, energy loss decreases and efficiency rises. Further, the stator current can be reduced relative to capacity, particularly so that the current is <measure type="value">19.0</measure> to <measure type="interval">24</measure> A per 1 MVA of generator or motor capacity. Against <quantifiedObject id="329725b8-45ea-4abc-9255-4647f94e4436">the capacity of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#329725b8-45ea-4abc-9255-4647f94e4436">2,000</measure>MVA, it is possible to reduce the current to <measure type="interval" ptr="#4e4ff755-30a5-43fc-b08e-06fbc5358185">19.0 to 20.0 A</measure>. At that time, the rotor is cooled by hydrogen. Depending on the output of the generator, <quantifiedObject id="3a846cd2-1570-42c9-af2e-bc4295c0b2ef">hydrogen pressure</quantifiedObject> must be raised, however, that pressure can be set to <measure type="value" ptr="#3a846cd2-1570-42c9-af2e-bc4295c0b2ef">0.003</measure> to <measure type="value">0.006kg/cm2</measure> per <measure type="value">1</measure>MVA. Particularly, <measure type="value">0.004</measure> to <measure type="value">0.005kg/cm 2</measure> .g is desired.</p>
	<p>[0051] Such shafts may be for generators or motors. For motors, a synchronous motor, synchronous generator motor and induced synchronous motor are available. The structures of motors and generators are almost the same. Preferably, we use a high speed motor providing a rotation speed of more than <measure type="interval">5,000rpm</measure>.</p>
	<p>[0052] The tensile strength of the rotor shaft is desired to be more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#35f5bac3-6edb-4f5e-8534-d4f07ccb8148">93</measure>kg/<quantifiedObject id="35f5bac3-6edb-4f5e-8534-d4f07ccb8148">mm</quantifiedObject> 2 or more preferably more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#2c9d62f0-4589-4d4b-8e83-a7d3c59ae49f">100</measure>kg/<quantifiedObject id="2c9d62f0-4589-4d4b-8e83-a7d3c59ae49f">mm 2</quantifiedObject> and particularly it is desirable to adjust the composition so as to obtain more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#b0c58a68-5b43-45c6-8ebb-ac02fb32051b">104</measure>kg/<quantifiedObject id="b0c58a68-5b43-45c6-8ebb-ac02fb32051b">mm 2</quantifiedObject> .

The crystal grain size number is desired to be more than  (ASTM crystal grain size). Additionally, as magnetic characteristic, magnetic field strength is desired to be less than <measure type="interval">990AT/cm</measure> at <measure type="value" ptr="#6a68643d-efea-43aa-9fe0-f06976680656">21 kG</measure> in magnetic flux density, and less than <measure type="interval">400AT/cm</measure> at <measure type="value">20kG</measure>.

No.1 is a material equivalent to ASTM standard A469-88 class 8 for generator rotor shaft material. No. 5 is a material containing relatively high Al content. These specimens underwent heat treatment by simulating the conditions for the large size rotor shaft centre of a large capacity generator. First, it was heated to <measure type="interval">840°C</measure> to form austenite structure and cooled at <quantifiedObject id="56635df3-ee4a-4e56-83aa-51f2bc02d0de">the speed of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#56635df3-ee4a-4e56-83aa-51f2bc02d0de">100°C/hour</measure> to harden.

	<p>[0060] The effects of various constituents are now considered in relation to the specific examples and comparison examples. Fig. 1 is a diagram showing the influence on the tensile strength of Cr content. The tensile strength increases as the Cr quantity increases, when the Ni quantity is <measure type="interval">2.60</measure> to <measure type="value">4.15%</measure>. Particularly, when Cr quantity exceeds <measure type="value">1.4%</measure>, the tensile strength increases rapidly so that the effect of Cr is large. If the quantity exceeds <measure type="value">2.0%</measure>, a high tensile strength over <measure type="value">100kg/mm 2</measure> can be obtained. Fig. 2 is a diagram showing the relationship with Ni/Cr ratio. The tensile strength decreases as Ni/Cr ratio increases. Particularly, a higher strength is obtained by setting the Ni/<quantifiedObject id="ea950d0e-3785-4be1-84a7-a3a1b03c90e8">Cr ratio</quantifiedObject> lower than <measure type="interval" ptr="#ea950d0e-3785-4be1-84a7-a3a1b03c90e8">2.1</measure>. While related to Ni quantity, a far <quantifiedObject id="b6362cc8-8a8e-4fda-bee8-d18bacbc3608">higher strength over</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#b6362cc8-8a8e-4fda-bee8-d18bacbc3608">100kg/mm 2</measure> is obtained by securing a high Ni quantity over <measure type="value">3.50%</measure>. This is obtained by setting Ni/Cr ratio below <measure type="interval" ptr="#09e78ee9-bebe-4bf4-a54c-28d6c6875491">2.3</measure> and <quantifiedObject id="09e78ee9-bebe-4bf4-a54c-28d6c6875491">Ni</quantifiedObject> below <measure type="interval" ptr="#1933da47-1473-46b1-a3f8-8c438af0f0cc">3.5%</measure> against <quantifiedObject id="d8926452-52c4-447d-b0f3-f64fcdcf81ce">the objective tensile strength of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#d8926452-52c4-447d-b0f3-f64fcdcf81ce">93kg/mm 2</measure> . In this case, if Ni is less than 3%, that tensile strength is difficult to obtain. Fig. 3 shows the relationship with Si quantity, indicating that the strength increases as the Si quantity increases. When Si quantity is more than <measure type="value" ptr="#f49784ee-24e8-4b86-87da-8daf3247b57d">0.17</measure><quantifiedObject id="f49784ee-24e8-4b86-87da-8daf3247b57d">%</quantifiedObject>, <measure type="value">93kg/mm 2</measure> is obtained by adjusting Cr and Ni to <measure type="interval">1.3 to 1.8%</measure> and <measure type="list">2.6</measure> to <measure type="interval">3.5%</measure> respectively, while if Cr exceeds <measure type="value">2%</measure>, when Si is as low as or less than <measure type="interval" ptr="#aa89a14d-89d1-421a-a82d-859bd748323f">0.1%93</measure>, more than kg/<quantifiedObject id="aa89a14d-89d1-421a-a82d-859bd748323f">mm 2 or</quantifiedObject> particularly more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#6b1095a3-fd96-4dd2-873e-a0ddbf6f5406">100</measure>kg/<quantifiedObject id="6b1095a3-fd96-4dd2-873e-a0ddbf6f5406">mm 2</quantifiedObject> is obtained. Fig. 4 is a diagram showing the influence on <measure type="value">50%</measure> fracture appearance transition temperature of Ni or Cr contents. As the content of Ni or Cr increases, FATT lowers, and particularly, when Si is less than <measure type="interval">0.1%</measure>, FATT below <measure type="interval">0°C0.5</measure> is obtained by making more than % Cr contained. Fig. 5 is a diagram showing the influence on FATT of Si quantity. As Si quantity decreases, FATT decreases so as to secure a high toughness. Particularly, when Ni is <measure type="interval">2.5 to 3.0%</measure> and Cr is <measure type="interval">1.3 to 1.8%</measure>, FATT can be lowered below <measure type="interval">0°C</measure> by adjusting Si quantity to below <measure type="interval">0.08%3.5</measure>, and when Ni is  to <measure type="interval">4.0%</measure> and Cr is <measure type="list">1.5</measure> to <measure type="interval">2.2%</measure>, the value can be lowered below <measure type="interval">0°C</measure> by adjusting Si quantity to below <measure type="value">0.13%</measure>. When Cr is over <measure type="value">2.2%</measure> and Ni is over <measure type="value">3.5%</measure>, FATT can be lowered below <measure type="interval">0°C</measure> by adjusting Si quantity less than 0.20%. Fig. 6 is a diagram showing the relationship between FATT and Al content. The Al content increases FATT. When Cr is <measure type="value">2.05</measure> to <measure type="value">2.2%</measure> and Ni is <measure type="interval">3 to 4%</measure>, FATT can be lowered below <measure type="interval">0°C</measure> by adjusting Al quantity to below <measure type="value">0.014%</measure>. When Cr is <measure type="interval">2.2 to 2.5%</measure> and Ni is <measure type="interval">3.5 to 4.5%</measure>, the value can be lowered below <measure type="interval">0°C</measure> by adjusting Al quantity to below <measure type="interval">0.018%</measure>. When Cr is near <measure type="value">1.65%</measure>, even if Ni quantity is as high as <measure type="value">3.5%</measure>, FATT is difficult to lower below<measure type="interval">0°C</measure> if Al quantity is reduced. Fig. 7 shows the relationship between magnetic field strength and Si quantity. Because the increase of Si quantity intensifies magnetic field strength as shown in the figure, the Si quantity should be as small as possible for present purposes. Particularly, when Cr is <measure type="list">1.5</measure> to <measure type="interval">2.5%2.5</measure> and Ni is  to <measure type="interval">4.5%</measure>, magnetic <quantifiedObject id="f205def3-e681-456d-84aa-e6104997f3c3">field strength at</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#f205def3-e681-456d-84aa-e6104997f3c3">21 kG</measure> can be suppressed below <measure type="interval" ptr="#a521693f-bf91-40a5-af77-d2a06652922b">990AT/cm</measure> by adjusting Si quantity to less than <measure type="interval">0.18%</measure>. Particularly, when Si quantity is less than <measure type="interval">0.1%</measure>, <quantifiedObject id="d640b87a-23f4-4419-86db-fd7bb034c6a0">a magnetic strength of</quantifiedObject> less than <measure type="interval" ptr="#d640b87a-23f4-4419-86db-fd7bb034c6a0">700AT/cm</measure> is obtained. Fig. 8 is a diagram showing the relationship between magnetizing force and the total amount of P, S, Sn, Sb and As. These impurities are undesirable because they increase magnetic field strength and their concentration should be less than <measure type="interval">0.040%</measure> to adjust magnetic field strength below <measure type="interval">990AT/cm</measure>. Particularly, it should be less than <measure type="interval">0.03%</measure> to lower it below <measure type="interval">700AT/cm</measure>. Fig. 9 shows the relationship between magnetic field strength and Al content. As shown in the figure, Al is undesirable because it intensifies magnetic field strength. When Cr is <measure type="list">1.5</measure> to <measure type="interval">2.5%2.5</measure> and Ni is  to <measure type="interval">4.5%</measure> and even when Si quantities are less than <measure type="interval">0.1%</measure>, Al quantity should be below <measure type="interval">0.025%</measure> to obtain a magnetic field strength of less than <measure type="interval">990AT/cm</measure>. Particularly, to obtain a magnetic field strength of less than <measure type="interval">700AT/cm</measure>, Al quantity should be lowered below <measure type="interval">0.015%</measure>. If Si quantity exceeds <measure type="value">0.1%</measure>, Al quantity should be less than <measure type="interval">0.01%</measure>. Fig. 10 shows the influence on magnetic field strength of the quantity of Si multiplied by the total amount of P, S, Sn, Sb and Ab and the higher this quantity is, the more inappropriate it is because magnetic field strength is increased. Magnetic field strength can be lowered below <measure type="interval" ptr="#fb37d4ee-6c47-4b9c-93ff-e73806c680fc">990AT/cm</measure> by adjusting the quantity to less than <measure type="value">70 x 10</measure> -4.</p>
	<p>[0061] Table 3 shows the results of the tensile test, impact test and magnetic characteristic test for the specimen provided by intensifying the strength of this invention steel No. 2 to <measure type="interval">4</measure> and 6. In this embodiment, the tempering temperature was set <measure type="value">5°C</measure> lower than in Embodiment 1.</p>
	<p>[0062] As evident from the table, the materials embodying the invention satisfied the mechanical performance and magnetic characteristic required even for <measure type="list" ptr="#b8bd0071-65b4-470b-89cd-805cd82db883">1,200</measure>MVA <quantifiedObject id="b8bd0071-65b4-470b-89cd-805cd82db883">class and</quantifiedObject> 1,<measure type="value">300</measure>MVA class generator rotor shaft, giving tensile strength more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#24ff45a3-aa83-4d7b-9fab-5e30d17a3d38">105</measure>kg/<quantifiedObject id="24ff45a3-aa83-4d7b-9fab-5e30d17a3d38">mm 2 ,</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value">0.02%</measure> yield strength more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#1c7abad9-7317-4577-8378-7cd092d3216b">82 , FATT below -44°C</measure>kg/<quantifiedObject id="1c7abad9-7317-4577-8378-7cd092d3216b">mm 2</quantifiedObject> and magnetic field strength less than <measure type="interval">400AT/cm1,200</measure>. Thus these materials can be said to be very useful, e.g. for a &gt; MVA class large capacity generator rotor shaft.</p>
	<p>[0064] Most thermal power turbine generators are 2-pole high-speed generators. The rotation speed is <measure type="value">3,000rpm</measure> at <measure type="value">50Hz</measure> and <measure type="value">3,600rpm</measure> at <measure type="value">60Hz</measure>. This is because the higher the rotation speed, the better the efficiency becomes and the size becomes smaller. In most cases, a tandem compound type generator generating output with a single axis is utilized. Most large capacity machines are of cross compound type, generating output with <measure type="value" ptr="#77b4ffe2-fcd3-4c92-8a37-d3cb767e5602">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="77b4ffe2-fcd3-4c92-8a37-d3cb767e5602">axes</quantifiedObject>, which is capable of generating more than the tandem compound type.</p>
	<p>[0065] The nuclear power turbine generator is usually 4-pole type and used at <measure type="value">1,500rpm</measure> or <measure type="value">1,800rpm</measure>. This is because a larger amount of vapor is generated from the nuclear reactor with a lower temperature and pressure, and the turbine has long blades and rotates at a low speed.</p>
	<p>[0070] 0.35 or <measure type="list" ptr="#26992659-3d9b-4301-b604-e33fb752ef71">0.5mm</measure> <quantifiedObject id="26992659-3d9b-4301-b604-e33fb752ef71">thick silicon steel plate</quantifiedObject> is used for the stator iron core 2 and this plate has a directivity. The iron core is formed by laminating by <measure type="interval">50</measure> to <measure type="value" ptr="#eb9c4576-c47c-4386-a0e6-5b0f4a184937">60mm</measure> in axial direction and an I-shaped gap steel is inserted to form an air duct.</p>
	<p>[0073] The main shaft is made of Ni-Cr-Mo-V steel, preferably of a type as described above. Although not illustrated, the fixing ring 17 for the fan 20 is provided between the <quantifiedObject id="2d44563f-4575-4839-a92e-6b9348f3d245">flange</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#2d44563f-4575-4839-a92e-6b9348f3d245">15</measure> and centering ring 18.</p>
	<p>[0074] The field winding coil 3 is distributed and wound in the slots of a rotor iron core between <quantifiedObject id="309ba915-7ef7-46fc-93ef-0242d1669110">the teeth</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#309ba915-7ef7-46fc-93ef-0242d1669110">12</measure> formed by winding copper belt flat, and a layer insulator is inserted by a single turn of the conductor. The end of the winding coil is held by a retaining ring 9. Usually, a silver contained copper having an excellent creep characteristic is used for the coil instead of copper.</p>
	<p>[0075] For the retaining ring 9, non-magnetic stainless steel with less than <measure type="interval">0.1%C0.4</measure>, more than %N 10-<measure type="interval" ptr="#8ff304e8-4c96-4a46-b43c-e981d5e74c3d">25%15</measure>Mn and -20%<quantifiedObject id="8ff304e8-4c96-4a46-b43c-e981d5e74c3d">Cr</quantifiedObject> is applied. After the winding wire 3 is buried, it is fastened with a wedge 13 made of ultra duralmin alloy For the end damper ring 14, an end or overall length damper is used, and Al alloy and silver contained copper are used for the end and body respectively. 8 is a shaft, 11 is a magnetic pole and <measure type="value">15</measure> is a coupling.</p>
	<p>[0076] A large capacity machine over <measure type="value">1,000</measure>MVA is difficult to cool evenly because the iron core is long, so a duplex ventilation method is applied.</p>
	<p>[0078] The gas pressure for cooling with hydrogen is 2atg for indirect hydrogen cooler, and <measure type="interval">2</measure> to 5atg for direct hydrogen cooler. Because when hydrogen gas pressure is increased, the calorific capacity of gas increases in proportion to density as heat transfer rate rises, thus the temperature rise of gas itself decreases in inverse proportion to the absolute pressure of gas so that the effect of cooling increases. Assuming that the output is <measure type="value">100</measure> when <measure type="value">0.05</measure>atg is provided with indirect cooling type, the output from the same dimension machine is <measure type="value">115</measure> under 1 atg, and <measure type="value" ptr="#f0ab1d62-2c32-4f27-b24f-7960a5e05a53">125</measure> under 2atg.</p>
	<p>[0079] Hydrogen cooling method has a danger of explosion in such a range that hydrogen volume is <measure type="interval">10 to 70%</measure> when mixed with air. To prevent this accident, hydrogen purity is automatically maintained over <measure type="interval" ptr="#98c5e0c6-625f-48ef-bdc4-8a1f21c19191">90</measure><quantifiedObject id="98c5e0c6-625f-48ef-bdc4-8a1f21c19191">%</quantifiedObject> and a sealing device to prevent hydrogen gas from leaking outside along the axis by means of oil film is provided inside of the bearing. Gas leakage is prevented by flowing oil having a higher pressure than hydrogen gas inside into the gap on the shaft.</p>
	<p>[0082] As cooling media, hydrogen gas, oil and water are available. Water has a heat transfer capacity about <measure type="value">50</measure> times air and excels as a cooling medium.</p>
	<p>[0085] Water cooling method makes the structure more complicated as compared with the hydrogen gas cooling method and thus is disadvantageous in reliability. However, the weight of the generator is <measure type="interval">15 to 25%</measure> lighter so that the efficiency with partial load can be improved.</p>
	<p>[0086] In the figure, 15 is a flange connected to the turbine, 20 is a fan, 21 is a stator coil, 22 is a brush and <measure type="value">23</measure> is a spring.</p>
	<p>[0087] Fig. 12 is a perspective view of a large capacity turbine generator rotor shaft having more than<quantifiedObject id="c9dd46a1-46ab-481d-bd4e-1b43da1eb945"> 1,000MW in tu</quantifiedObject>rbine output (<measure type="value" ptr="#90d95840-bf1a-4597-bedd-85311cead648">1,120</measure>tor capacity) embodying this invention. The rotor shaft embodying this invention was produced as explained below.</p>
	<p>[0088] To aim at almost the same composition as specimen No. 2 described in embodiment 1, molten metal of <quantifiedObject id="f867ec74-a00f-429e-ac15-07746f8e7fbb">about EP</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#f867ec74-a00f-429e-ac15-07746f8e7fbb">0 505 085 B2 150</measure>ton, prepared by vacuum ladle refining after melting in the air, was poured into a mold. On the next step, the casting was hot forged by press, <quantifiedObject id="d685e891-f282-42f7-a3de-4e987d0f27fd">upset</quantifiedObject> (forging ratio: <measure type="value" ptr="#d685e891-f282-42f7-a3de-4e987d0f27fd">1/2U</measure>) and then lengthened (forging ratio: 3S). Further, after unifying annealing was performed at <measure type="value">900°C</measure>, the material was cut to a specified shape, then heated and held at <measure type="value" ptr="#fea0b294-ea31-416d-9c5a-4c27729cae4c">840°C</measure> in a vertical furnace for <measure type="value">20 hours</measure>, and hardened by cooling at the speed of <measure type="value" ptr="#c3f8bcdd-20c1-4ba0-83ef-4b8508759e85">100°C/hour</measure> at the centre hole by water spray. Then, after heating and being held at <measure type="value">580°C</measure> for <measure type="value">60 hours</measure>, the material was tempered by cooling at <quantifiedObject id="09495dfa-744c-4b15-be13-cc078865e683">the speed of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#09495dfa-744c-4b15-be13-cc078865e683">15°C/ hour</measure>. After that, it was cut to the final shape as shown in Fig. 12. This embodiment is for <measure type="value" ptr="#561affb2-ea17-4184-aebf-03248fb1dc07">2</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="561affb2-ea17-4184-aebf-03248fb1dc07">pole type</quantifiedObject>, and 11 is a magnetic pole, 12 is teeth, 17 is fan mounting ring, 18 is retaining ring fitting centering ring, and 19 is center hole. A test piece was collected from this material to inspect its mechanical, electric and magnetic characteristics. The centering ring 18 is integrated on forming the shaft and a retaining ring is shrinkage fit after cutting to ring like shape.</p>
	<p>[0089] In this embodiment, the overall length is about <measure type="value">15m</measure>, the diameter of the body on which teeth are provided is <measure type="value">1.2m</measure>, and the length of the body is about <measure type="value">7m</measure>, about <measure type="value" ptr="#dea3a4a2-c494-4255-b538-bd1ce396f7a5">5.7</measure> times <quantifiedObject id="dea3a4a2-c494-4255-b538-bd1ce396f7a5">the diameter of</quantifiedObject> the body. The machine size of this embodiment is about <measure type="value">10m</measure> 3 , thus the rotor's sensitivity to vibration is reduced, so that the sensitivity to imbalance in the same phase can be suppressed and at the same time, a high axis stability is obtained because the flexibility of the shaft drops.</p>

The length of the body is desired to be <measure type="interval" ptr="#a6545420-8d2e-456e-af27-6fba6bec46bb">5.5 to 6.5</measure> times <quantifiedObject id="a6545420-8d2e-456e-af27-6fba6bec46bb">the diameter</quantifiedObject>. [0100]</p>
	<p>[0101] The structure as described makes it possible to reduce the rotor's sensitivity to vibration and make a compact generator unit. Because tensile strength is more than <measure type="interval">93</measure>kg/mm 2 , <measure type="value">50%</measure> fracture transition temperature is below <measure type="interval">0°C</measure> and the magnetizing force at <measure type="value">21 kG</measure> is less than <measure type="interval" ptr="#fca7bdb1-c228-4a65-bf78-03e15d8ab695">900AT/cm900</measure>, a compact large capacity generator of more than MVA in capacity or synchronous motor having a rotation speed of more than <measure type="interval">5000</measure>rpm can be produced. Hence, effective use of the installation area is enabled, so that this contributes to diversification of energy including petroleum, coal and nuclear power for power generation.</p>
