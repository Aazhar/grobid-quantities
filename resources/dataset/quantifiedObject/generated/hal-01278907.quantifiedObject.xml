	<p>The main benefit of an interstellar mission is to carry out in-situ measurements within a target star system. To allow for extended in-situ measurements, the spacecraft needs to be decelerated. One of the currently most promising technologies for deceleration is the magnetic sail which uses the deflection of interstellar matter via a magnetic field to decelerate the spacecraft. However, while the magnetic sail is very efficient at high velocities, its performance decreases with lower speeds. This leads to <quantifiedObject id="411361b8-434a-40cc-931d-207dd917f0f3">deceleration durations of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#411361b8-434a-40cc-931d-207dd917f0f3">several decades</measure> depending on the spacecraft mass. Within the context of Project Dragonfly, initiated by the Initiative of Interstellar Studies (i4is), this paper proposes a novel concept for decelerating a spacecraft on an interstellar mission by combining a magnetic sail with an electric sail. Combining the sails compensates for each technologys shortcomings: A magnetic sail is more effective at higher velocities than the electric sail and vice versa. It is demonstrated that using both sails sequentially outperforms using only the magnetic or electric sail for various mission scenarios and velocity ranges, at a constant total spacecraft mass. For example, for decelerating from <measure type="value" ptr="#be8ccb89-ef74-438f-bc27-c78fe2dde765">5%</measure> <quantifiedObject id="be8ccb89-ef74-438f-bc27-c78fe2dde765">c</quantifiedObject>, to interplanetary velocities, a spacecraft with both sails needs about <measure type="value">29 years</measure>, whereas the electric sail alone would take <measure type="value">35 years</measure> and the magnetic sail about <measure type="value" ptr="#91c157c6-661d-4d5e-b31d-d8fb662620d1">40 years</measure> with <quantifiedObject id="69bdf4d7-c91b-4671-9b15-d3a80eeb3769">a total spacecraft mass of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#69bdf4d7-c91b-4671-9b15-d3a80eeb3769">8250 kg</measure>. Furthermore, it is assessed how the combined deceleration system affects the optimal overall mission architecture for different spacecraft masses and cruising speeds. Future work would investigate how operating both systems in parallel instead of sequentially would affect its performance. Moreover, uncertainties in the density of interstellar matter and sail properties need to be explored.</p>
	<p><measure type="value" ptr="#4a6725ba-e913-4708-90d8-97922c15edd4">Two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="4a6725ba-e913-4708-90d8-97922c15edd4">attractive concepts</quantifiedObject> rely on utilizing magnetic and electric fields in order to deflect incoming ions of the interstellar space and thereby decelerate effectively.</p>
	<p>These systems called Magnetic Sail (Msail) and Electric Sail (Esail) were first proposed by Zubrin [6] and Janhunen [7] respectively. Since each one of those systems has a different design point and velocity application regime in which it performs optimally, the combination of the <measure type="value">two</measure> can induce great flexibility in the mission design as well as better performance. To demonstrate these points, the example of a mission to Alpha Centauri is analyzed. This star system was chosen because it is the closest <measure type="interval">one</measure> to the earth at <quantifiedObject id="9cb42ef3-a48e-4c17-bf1a-732e30f46330">a distance of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#9cb42ef3-a48e-4c17-bf1a-732e30f46330">4.35 light years</measure> and because the deceleration concept described in this paper, was inspired by the Dragonfly Competition of the i4is, which involved a light-powered light sail mission to Alpha Centauri [8].</p>
	<p>where m p is the mass of the proton, n o the number density of interstellar ions, µ the free space permeability, I the current through the sail, R its radius and v its speed. Values for n o are proposed in [10] in the case of a space probe traveling to Alpha Centauri. In <quantifiedObject id="86f222bd-40eb-4a6b-aa44-4a7c77f7a36f">this work</quantifiedObject>, a rather conservative value was implemented, with n o = <measure type="value" ptr="#86f222bd-40eb-4a6b-aa44-4a7c77f7a36f">0.03 cm −3</measure> corresponding to the expected values in the Local Bubble [10].</p>
	<p>The main structural component introducing extra mass into the system is the sail itself, as well as its shielding and its deployment mechanism. The mass of the sail is defined by the maximal current density that can be achieved with the superconducting material, since this dictates the minimal cross sectional area for a specific current. According to Zubrin [6], the current densities of superconductors can reach up to j max = <measure type="value">2 · 10 10 A/m 2</measure> and this is the value used in the analysis. For the material of the sail, the density of common superconductors like <quantifiedObject id="fad5fa24-aefc-429b-84a0-5f92c7caa549">copper oxide (CuO) and YBCO</quantifiedObject> was used, with ρ Msail = <measure type="value" ptr="#fad5fa24-aefc-429b-84a0-5f92c7caa549">6000 kg/m 3</measure> .</p>
	<p>For the tether and support structures, a mass equal to <measure type="value" ptr="#b0276fcf-3544-48e2-b604-050871a6e704">15 %</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="b0276fcf-3544-48e2-b604-050871a6e704">the sail mass</quantifiedObject> was used.</p>
	<p>It is evident from the formula in Equation 1, that the magnetic sail is efficient for higher current values and larger dimensions. In the analyses presented in this work, the radius of the Msail was limited to <measure type="interval">50 km</measure>. Although even larger dimensions can demonstrate better performance, it was thought that the deployment of bigger radii is far from the current or near-future technological capabilities and was therefore excluded from the analyses.</p>
	<p>The main disadvantage of the magnetic sail is also evident when taking the force formula into account. At lower speeds, the force keeps getting reduced asymptotically, and hence the effect of the Msail at these velocities becomes negligible. This has as consequence that reaching orbital speeds (<measure type="interval">10-100 km/s</measure>) requires long deceleration duration. A magnetic sail would therefore be optimal for missions where no orbital insertion or surface operations in planetary systems are required but where a deceleration for prolonged measurements in the target system is sufficient. Its inefficiency in lower speeds indicates the need for a secondary system able to bring the velocity down to orbital values.</p>
	<p>In the Debye length definition, o is the electric permittivity of vacuum, k b the Boltzmann constant and T e the electron temperature of the interstellar plasma. T e was estimated according to [10], so for the present analysis the value T e = <measure type="value">8000 K</measure> was used. The wires were designed according to [11], with radius r w = <measure type="value">5 µm</measure> and <quantifiedObject id="922700c7-df2f-4f47-ae73-f4f19ad38196">density</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#922700c7-df2f-4f47-ae73-f4f19ad38196">1500 kg/m</measure> 3 It is evident from Equation 4, that the force increases proportionally to the number and length of the tethers as well as for a higher voltage. The dependency of the Esail force on the velocity of the probe however, displays a more complex character than the one for the Msail. Figure 1 demonstrates this effect qualitatively for a constant total length of the tethers. It follows that the Esail is effective only within a region close to its maximal force. In <quantifiedObject id="c17a5ac4-ef3b-4c65-9402-f26a727e79ac">order</quantifiedObject> to decelerate a probe efficiently from high cruising speeds (≥ <measure type="value" ptr="#c17a5ac4-ef3b-4c65-9402-f26a727e79ac">0.04 c</measure>) down to orbital values, a very high voltage is required according to Figure 1, or an increased total length of the tethers. However an increase in tether length and voltage does not only imply a higher mass of the wires, but also a bigger power supply system. The positively charged tethers collide with the interstellar plasma electrons, which leads to a decrease of the voltage. In order to maintain the positive voltage of the wires, an electron gun has to be placed on board, leading to an additional mass for the power supply subsystem. The required power is described by Equation 6 [11]:</p>
	<p>with m e being the mass of the electron. The total mass of the Esail is put together from the mass of the tethers and the power system required for the operation of the electron gun. In the present work, the power system for the Esail was modeled with a specific power supply of <measure type="value">50 W/kg</measure>. Although the details of the power system were not part of this analysis, photovoltaic cells could be used, utilizing the laser beam power in combination with radioisotope thermoelectric generators and batteries. Another option is the use of electromagnetic tethers as an energy source, by means of electromagnetic induction as described in [12].</p>
	<p>After establishing the properties and the disadvantages of the individual sails in Section 2, the benefits of combining the <measure type="value" ptr="#2e94c3c2-ff7c-443d-9167-4e7f89076466">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="2e94c3c2-ff7c-443d-9167-4e7f89076466">subsystems</quantifiedObject> for an effective deceleration in interstellar missions become clear.</p>
	<p>Missions to neighboring star systems require high cruising speeds in order to reduce the total trip duration. There have been proposals based on fusion propulsion that aim to keep the total mission duration underneath <measure type="value">100 years</measure> [3], [13], which means that an average speed bigger than <measure type="value">0.0435 c</measure> is necessary in the case of Alpha Centauri [14]. The present analysis focuses on missions with the objective of performing scientific measurements in the target system, hence requiring orbital insertion around a star or a planet. In this context, the combination of Msail and Esail seems to be an elegant solution.</p>
	<p>Starting the deceleration phase of the mission with the use of a magnetic sail is beneficial as mentioned in Section 2.1, due to the high forces produced in the large velocity range. As the velocity decreases, the force drops also and the Msail starts being ineffective. At this moment (which has to be optimally chosen as described later), the Msail can be switched off and detached from the spacecraft and the Esail can start operating. The electric sail must be designed to perform optimally in this velocity region and can decrease the velocity of the spacecraft further, until the required value for orbital insertion is achieved. The high flexibility of the tandem system comes in the expense of additional optimization effort. The <measure type="value" ptr="#599cd4d5-73f4-4799-9090-c7570952f622">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="599cd4d5-73f4-4799-9090-c7570952f622">subsystems</quantifiedObject> are dependent on each other and have to be designed simultaneously and an extra optimization parameter influences their design, namely the velocity value at which the start of operation for the Esail takes place.</p>
	<p>The switching method presented in this paper is only <measure type="value">one</measure> of the alternatives that can be realized with a combination of Msail and Esail. A further option would be that the Esail starts operation simultaneously with the Msail even at higher speeds, where it is not so effective. One would expect that this extra bit of braking force could improve the overall performance. This idea was not implemented in the present analysis, because the Esail tethers can be used for energy production according to [12] for the velocities that are far from their optimal design point. This way, instead of spending electric power for the operation of the Esail, which only has a small effect on the overall deceleration, the Esail can serve as a significant power supply source.</p>
	<p>Additionally, allowing the Msail to operate even at the velocity regime where it has lost its efficiency in parallel to the Esail instead of detaching it, would increase the decelerating force. However, the mass being decelerated would also increase and hence the magnitude of acceleration would not necessarily improve. A complete optimization model could include the start of operation of the Esail and the detachment of the Msail as <measure type="value" ptr="#349c0425-758f-482d-b21d-3ca6bb4c9989">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="349c0425-758f-482d-b21d-3ca6bb4c9989">separate events</quantifiedObject>. This brings some additional complexity to the model since it requires the optimization of a further parameter. However, it was examined for a single test case which is not in the scope of this paper and the obtained results showed a &lt; <measure type="interval">5%</measure> performance improvement, so it was ignored in this analysis.</p>
	<p>The combination of the <measure type="value" ptr="#c6a8d9b3-a1d0-4b8e-95cd-ae29f50fce97">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c6a8d9b3-a1d0-4b8e-95cd-ae29f50fce97">sails</quantifiedObject> requires the optimization of the individual parameters for Msail and Esail (radius and current of superconductive loop, voltage, number and length of tethers) as well as of the velocity at which the operation of the Msail ceases.</p>
	<p>To determine T decel for a given sail configuration, the mass of the system and the force profile over time are necessary. The parameters N,L,V o ,R and I allow for the determination of m Esail and m Msail . The combination of Msail and Esail requires the additional parameter of the switching velocity v switch which results to the force profile. Combining the mass and the force leads to the acceleration capabilities of the system. This way, the optimization parameters of the mathematical problem are summarized in Table 1 for the <measure type="value">three</measure> deceleration methods.</p>
	<p>Finally, the total deceleration distance r decel poses a further constraint. It has to be ensured, that there is sufficient distance available for the spacecraft to decelerate completely before it reaches Alpha Centauri. For that reason this should remain shorter than <measure type="interval">4.35</measure> light years.</p>
	<p>At the same time, there has to be some finite distance available for the acceleration and cruising phases, which are not part of the optimization and this was estimated equal to <measure type="value">1.5 light years</measure>. For that reason, the constraint was defined as in Equation 14:</p>
	<p>Using the optimization method in Section 4, the performance of <measure type="value" ptr="#ad57729d-26d0-4601-a690-c095b5516b10">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="ad57729d-26d0-4601-a690-c095b5516b10">separate deceleration methods</quantifiedObject> was compared and the resuls are shown in this section. The <measure type="value">three</measure> deceleration architectures are the following:</p>
	<p>In this test case, the mass of the spacecraft m s/c was chosen to be approximately equal to the launch mass of Voyager 1, so equal to <measure type="value">750 kg</measure>. Voyager is a space probe which was launched to perform flybys of Jupiter, Saturn and Titan and continued to explore the boundaries of the outer heliosphere [17]. Since it is the only manmade probe so close to entering the interstellar space [18], it was considered relevant to calculate how its deceleration would look like in the case of a mission to another star system, requiring a deceleration phase.</p>
	<p>Only the deceleration phase of the mission was examined, so a cruising speed v cruise = <measure type="value">0.05 c</measure> was chosen. The target speed was set to be equal to v target = <measure type="value">35 km/s</measure>. This would correspond approximately to the orbital speed at a distance of <measure type="value" ptr="#96a19b3b-c78b-455f-85c0-418fd3103977">1 AU</measure> around Alpha Centauri A, which has a mass of <measure type="value">1.1 M</measure> [19].</p>
	<p>For each one of the <measure type="value">three</measure> deceleration methods, an optimal design point was calculated in order to minimize the total deceleration duration T decel . The mass of the deceleration system was restricted to be underneath <measure type="value">7500 kg</measure>, which corresponds to the tenfold spacecraft mass. A direct comparison is thereby possible, since all systems have the same effect on the acceleration phase and hence the overall mission design.</p>
	<p>At this point it has to be noted, that the restriction of the Msail radius described in Section 2.1 produces very week forces in the low speed limit (close to v target ), thereby resulting in <quantifiedObject id="eae900fb-f27a-40bc-be46-bfcaa0b34ad0">duration close</quantifiedObject> to <measure type="value" ptr="#eae900fb-f27a-40bc-be46-bfcaa0b34ad0">300 years</measure>. It was therefore dismissed from the calculations of pure Msail deceleration. The results shown here required a sail radius of <measure type="value">1000 km</measure>, which was considered to be unrealistic but was still included for completion. This demonstrates once again that the Msail as a standalone component is not sufficient for missions requiring orbital insertion in the target system.</p>
	<p>The acceleration and velocity profiles over time are shown in Figure 3 and 4 respectively. Note that the curves in Figure 3 represent the magnitude of the acceleration, since the numeric values of acceleration are negative during the braking phase. The combination of the <measure type="value" ptr="#265171c2-46b3-4c5a-8322-bec92af760f8">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="265171c2-46b3-4c5a-8322-bec92af760f8">sails</quantifiedObject> requires <measure type="value">28.8 years</measure> as opposed to the <measure type="value" ptr="#8eca8a30-cce1-4f3e-b01b-c4fbd60ac6ab">39.7 years</measure> of the Msail and the <measure type="value" ptr="#3b0a99e8-9337-4cd5-903a-907405f3aba6">34.9 years</measure> of the Esail. In the acceleration profile of the dual system, the discontinuity in the gradient represents the point where the switch between Msail and Esail takes place. This occurs after <measure type="value">13.67 years</measure> and at <quantifiedObject id="499b31a3-e3a9-481d-a93c-34dda1a8af6a">a speed equal</quantifiedObject> to approximately <measure type="value" ptr="#499b31a3-e3a9-481d-a93c-34dda1a8af6a">0.03 c</measure> according to Figure 4. This change is not detectable in the velocity profile, since the acceleration shows no discontinuity during the switch from the one system to the other, leading to a smooth velocity curve.</p>
	<p>At this point, it is also important to mention that the pure Msail method is the optimal solution when a<quantifiedObject id="fdbb19f6-bfce-44b6-963c-f71bb1b93a48"> higher target spe</quantifiedObject>ed is needed. Figure 4 demonstrates this effect since the velocity curve of the Msail is lower than the other <measure type="value" ptr="#fdbb19f6-bfce-44b6-963c-f71bb1b93a48">two</measure> for the whole duration apart from the lower velocity range, where it flattens. The absence of orbital insertion (leading to v target being an order of magnitude larger), would therefore make the Msail the most effective solution. This test case demonstrates the potential that a combination of Msail and Esail has in the design of an interstellar mission, since it outperforms each individual system in particular mission configurations. However, during a complete mission design, the minimal deceleration duration is not the only parameter to be optimized and the interaction of the deceleration system with the other components (influence on acceleration, effect of deceleration distance) has to be taken into account.</p>
	<p>In Section 3, a single value for the cruising speed was examined. In this section, the effect of a variable cruising speed on the design characteristics of the tandem deceleration system is presented. For this analysis, <measure type="value" ptr="#22b37eb4-e1a9-4b6b-a466-1fbfd5e4ab01">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="22b37eb4-e1a9-4b6b-a466-1fbfd5e4ab01">different spacecraft masses</quantifiedObject> are compared. Apart from the Voyager-like spacecraft introduced in Section 3, <quantifiedObject id="ddba81d3-69ca-43f4-bc01-9b882691ab3a">the profile of</quantifiedObject> a heavier vehicle with m s/c = <measure type="value" ptr="#ddba81d3-69ca-43f4-bc01-9b882691ab3a">4000 kg</measure> is calculated. This value was chosen since it is approximately equal to the launch mass of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). This robotic space probe was sent to Mars and included a rover with a landing system and instruments for biological, geochemical and geological measurements on the surface of the planet [20]. Since a similar mission to an exoplanet would be of high scientific value [13], an MSLlike spacecraft was used. The restriction for the total mass of the deceleration system being maximally <measure type="value">ten</measure> times the spacecraft mass was maintained. 6 show the dependency of the deceleration duration and distance on the cruising speed. It is intuitive that a larger initial speed requires a larger deceleration duration, since the total ∆v that has to be provided by the deceleration system increases.</p>
	<p>The same occurs for the deceleration distance, as Figure 6 demonstrates. A higher spacecraft mass also increases the inertia of the system during deceleration and hence the time and distance required. An important indirect result stemming from Figure 6 is that high cruising speeds are not always optimal for a minimal mission duration. In the case of the <measure type="value" ptr="#7c2b0a8b-97d1-4287-83b9-988c856d613f">4000 kg</measure> <quantifiedObject id="7c2b0a8b-97d1-4287-83b9-988c856d613f">spacecraft</quantifiedObject>, a 0.1 c cruising speed leads to a deceleration distance close to <measure type="value">2.5</measure> light years. When taking into account that the distance to Alpha Centauri is <measure type="value">4.35 light years</measure>, one deduces that there are only <measure type="value">1.85 light years</measure> available for the acceleration and cruising phases. However, the buildup of such a high speed could require a larger acceleration distance depending on the propulsion system. Therefore, reaching such a high speed in a mission to Alpha Centauri may not be necessary or useful, due to the extreme deceleration distance connected to it.</p>
	<p>The effect of the tandem deceleration system mass on its performance was examined. In the previous sections, the requirement of the deceleration system mass being smaller than <measure type="value" ptr="#d8ba095f-f9a1-4ab7-8e6e-3c9d62aaaaf6">ten</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d8ba095f-f9a1-4ab7-8e6e-3c9d62aaaaf6">times</quantifiedObject> the spacecraft mass was utilized. This boundary condition was introduced so that an easier comparison between different configurations could take place. In the present analysis however, the ratio between deceleration system mass and spacecraft mass was varied. The <measure type="value">two</measure> spacecraft masses described in Section 6.1 as well as <measure type="value" ptr="#e2980d7e-4062-4fe4-aba7-7080b3b9ac32">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e2980d7e-4062-4fe4-aba7-7080b3b9ac32">different cases for</quantifiedObject> the cruising speed were compared to each other. Figure 9 shows the results. An increased mass of the deceleration system leads, as expected, to a shorter deceleration duration. It is however notable, that the curves tend to saturate for larger masses. This implies that a larger deceleration mass, although having a great impact on the design of the acceleration phase because of additional inertia, only provides a small benefit to the overall deceleration performance. Quantitatively, taking the example of the <measure type="value" ptr="#9ccade94-c528-4dd6-a890-6c0ea9626ecc">4000 kg</measure> <quantifiedObject id="9ccade94-c528-4dd6-a890-6c0ea9626ecc">spacecraft</quantifiedObject> with <measure type="value">0.08 c</measure> cruising speed in Figure 9, one observes that a mass ratio of <measure type="value">10</measure> leads to a minimal duration equal to <measure type="value">53.83 years</measure> whereas a mass ratio equal to <measure type="value" ptr="#f02f3243-dd27-4bf4-a3c4-eac5878c79ba">4</measure> <quantifiedObject id="f02f3243-dd27-4bf4-a3c4-eac5878c79ba">results in</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#acb14b99-f697-4eee-aa84-beb782237d50">55.90 years</measure>. Hence an increase of <measure type="value" ptr="#4733e4d2-8082-493b-84e3-62ee59f94561">150 %</measure> in the mass of the deceleration system, produces only a <measure type="value">3.7 %</measure> increase in the performance of the system. This trend is maintained for all configurations and it is evident, that when the complete mission is designed and all mission phases are optimized simultaneously, deceleration system masses are preferred, which are further from the saturation limit and still produce sufficient performance.</p>
	<p>The present paper demonstrated that a combination of the <measure type="value" ptr="#5a283ea0-4ab0-437f-8428-33e45c713c2f">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5a283ea0-4ab0-437f-8428-33e45c713c2f">systems</quantifiedObject> in tandem (initial deceleration with Msail and following braking with Esail) can have a better performance in certain configurations. Small unmanned missions were examined in this context and a generalization of this method for manned missions with larger spacecraft masses would be interesting since it would show the applicability limits of the system. The combination of the <measure type="value" ptr="#df6cc4b4-76ee-444e-b28b-db482311b92d">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="df6cc4b4-76ee-444e-b28b-db482311b92d">systems</quantifiedObject> in series is not the only method that could improve the deceleration characteristics. Although this was the main architecture analyzed in the paper, operation of the <measure type="value" ptr="#87299c74-1521-4e8b-8c05-7ae7864db877">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="87299c74-1521-4e8b-8c05-7ae7864db877">sails</quantifiedObject> in parallel should also be further examined and controlled for additional increase in performance.</p>
	<p>The overall design of an interstellar mission requires the optimization of the deceleration system not as a standalone component, but simultaneously with the main propulsion system of the acceleration phase and with the design of the cruising phase. The flexibility of the combination of the <measure type="value" ptr="#b78562c0-2480-4295-943f-cb7a167d7d58">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b78562c0-2480-4295-943f-cb7a167d7d58">sails</quantifiedObject> includes further optimization parameters in the mission architecture, since the switching point between Msail and Esail deceleration has to be also optimized for maximal performance.</p></text>
