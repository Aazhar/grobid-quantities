Changes of CTC count during treatment were not a surrogate of TtP, with any of the model tested (threshold based or relative decrease in percent).

Conclusion: Bevacizumab combined with first-line chemotherapy may modify the predictive value of CTC during treatment possibly due to impaired tumor cells intravasation through vessels endothelium. Variations in CEC levels appear to be a promising early surrogate marker of TtP under antiangiogenic treatment.</p><p>Several methods for the detection of cancer cells disseminated in the bone marrow and/or circulating in the peripheral blood of patients have been developed recently for the most common epithelial tumors. Beyond biological characterization of the metastatic process, disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection can be used in a few clinical settings as a prognostic factor and/or as an early surrogate marker of treatment response [1,2]. In patients with metastatic breast cancer, it has been reported that DTC detection was not clinically relevant, whereas CTC detection was of prognostic significance [3]. Currently, the most commonly used detection system in this setting is the automated and standardized CellSearchÒ assay [4], which has a validated reproducibility [5]. In a pivotal study reported by Cristofanilli et al. in 2004 [6], CTCs were screened by this system in patients who received hormonal treatments or chemotherapy as first-or second-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In patients under standard chemotherapy, CTC positivity at baseline was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS; <measure type="value">2.7</measure> versus <measure type="value">7.0 months</measure>; P &lt; <measure type="interval">0.001</measure>) and <quantifiedObject id="8c3a9162-6ba3-4e60-b336-f31f5a4c5766">overall survival</quantifiedObject> (OS; <measure type="value" ptr="#8c3a9162-6ba3-4e60-b336-f31f5a4c5766">10.1</measure> versus &gt;<measure type="interval" ptr="#703435f1-28ca-4bc9-ae85-fc2e6c009d52">18; P &lt; 0.001</measure> <quantifiedObject id="703435f1-28ca-4bc9-ae85-fc2e6c009d52">months</quantifiedObject>).

Treatment with bevacizumab was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal.

All samples were obtained with the patient's written informed consent, after approval by the regional ethics committee. Neither patients nor clinicians were informed of the results of CTC and CEC analysis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CA 15-3 levels were also investigated before the first treatment cycle (baseline) and before cycle 3 (C3). There was no prior publication on this cohort of patients.</p><p>Briefly, <measure type="value">two</measure> CellSaveÒ tubes of blood (one tube for CTC and the other for CEC analysis) were drawn at baseline and before C3, i.e. <measure type="value" ptr="#f300605b-4455-4a85-a131-55bc76a66435">6 weeks</measure> after <quantifiedObject id="f300605b-4455-4a85-a131-55bc76a66435">the start</quantifiedObject> and processed within <measure type="list"> of the treatment, at the time of physician consultations. Samples were maintained at room temperature9672</measure> (CTC samples) or  (CEC samples) h after collection. All evaluations were carried out with no knowledge of the patient's clinical status. The standardized CellSearchÒ technique has been reported previously for CTC [4] and CEC [17] detection. Briefly, CTCs expressing the epithelial cell adhesion molecule were immunomagnetically enriched and stained with 4,2-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (+), cytokeratin 8,18,19 (+) and CD45 (2). CECs expressing CD146 were immunomagnetically enriched and stained with DAPI (+), CD105 (+) and CD45 (2). CTC and CEC morphology was confirmed in all cases.

According to MO19391 study end points, TtP was measured from the time treatment began to the time documented progression occurred (i.e. not taking into account deaths occurring before tumor progression). Tumor response to treatment was evaluated as per standard of care and included complete and partial responses. Initially, the ‡5-CTC/<measure type="value" ptr="#2b4f14b6-d7e1-448e-bead-c524a92102aa">7.5 ml</measure> <quantifiedObject id="2b4f14b6-d7e1-448e-bead-c524a92102aa">threshold</quantifiedObject> was used to define CTC positivity (for Table 1). The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was applied for dichotomous and categorical data, and the Student's t-test or analysis of variance was used to compare continuous variables between groups. For comparison of quantitative parameters, if the normality hypothesis was not fulfilled, nonparametric tests were used as Wilcoxon test or Kruskall-Wallis test. Signed rank test was used to compare quantitative parameter between baseline and before C3. Correlation between CTCs and CECs was studied using linear regression. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze TtP for each group of interest defined by CEC or CTC thresholds, and Cox regression model was used to provide the hazard ratio and its <measure type="value">95%</measure> confidence interval (CI).

CEC count change between baseline and before C3 was statistically significant (P = <measure type="value">0.013</measure>).

No association was seen between CEC count and metastatic sites (type and number). We found no association between CEC levels and CTC levels or positivity (according to the ‡5 CTC/<measure type="value" ptr="#06d12fea-f323-4b89-bdff-2b7931c6d7ff">7.5 ml</measure> <quantifiedObject id="06d12fea-f323-4b89-bdff-2b7931c6d7ff">threshold</quantifiedObject>).</p><p>The patient characteristics at baseline were not associated with tumor response or TtP (Table 1). At baseline, CTC prognostic value was assessed using different thresholds to define CTC positivity (Table 2).

At baseline, CEC count was not associated with tumor response or TtP, at any threshold (Table 2). We further studied whether CTC and CEC count changes under treatment may be correlated with tumor response and used as an early surrogate of TtP. Results are shown in Table 3. Strikingly, focusing on CTC count, all threshold-based and relative change-based models failed to accurately predict tumor response or TtP. On the contrary, TtP was significantly associated with CEC changes, using the threshold-based model, at <quantifiedObject id="5b8fef63-2647-42bf-a0d9-544e3d9e53b8">the threshold of</quantifiedObject> ‡20 CEC/<measure type="value" ptr="#5b8fef63-2647-42bf-a0d9-544e3d9e53b8">4 ml</measure> (P &lt; <measure type="interval">0.01</measure>; Table 3; see also Figure 2A). More simply, TtP was also associated with the CEC status before C3, using the ‡20-CEC/<measure type="value">4 ml</measure> threshold ( Figure 2B; P = <measure type="value">0.003</measure>). Among relative change-based models, a relative increase of <measure type="value" ptr="#6412492b-14ff-4a27-b81a-6a8f386ff662">50%</measure> of CEC count during treatment was trended toward significance (P = <measure type="value">0.06</measure>). In comparison, neither LDH and CA 15-3 serum levels before C3 nor their changes between baseline and C3 were associated with TtP or to tumor response (data not shown).

Moreover, the fact that we do describe in our series the significant correlations of <quantifiedObject id="adf55123-cb30-4dcc-930b-dfa1ffccd4d9">CTC positivity</quantifiedObject> ( ‡5 CTC/ <measure type="value" ptr="#adf55123-cb30-4dcc-930b-dfa1ffccd4d9">7.5 ml</measure> <measure type="value">) with high CA 15-3 serum marker and with bone metastatic site, which have been also reported by Nole et al. [9] and De Giorgi et al. [19], does not support a lack of power of our study. The lack of clinical relevance of CTC changes during treatment might also be due to the difference in the CTC count schedule, as it was before C2 (i.e. theoretically at day21</measure> <measure type="value" ptr="#34983a58-31e9-4345-932f-1c0dc3d0e735">) in the study by Cristofanilli et al.

[9] and before C3 (i.e. theoretically at day42</measure> <measure type="interval">) in our study. However, a recent retrospective study of the series by Cristofanilli's group showed that later CTC count (i.e. between day56 and</measure> <quantifiedObject id="6c7b0e5c-6007-4044-a4da-e73685f2bdac">day</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#6c7b0e5c-6007-4044-a4da-e73685f2bdac">91</measure>) retained a strong 1.00 a 0.55 b prognostic relevance in patients treated by standard chemotherapy alone [20]. We therefore favor the hypothesis that the lack of CTC significance during treatment is directly related to the systematic use of bevacizumab in our homogeneously treated series of patients. In our study, CTC counts were in line with previous studies at baseline but unusually low after <measure type="value" ptr="#69489df3-2b64-48bc-ad2b-7adabb77b2c7">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="69489df3-2b64-48bc-ad2b-7adabb77b2c7">cycles of</quantifiedObject> treatment compared with previous studies (without bevacizumab): <measure type="value" ptr="#c4a14b1b-32e5-4ee0-8ab8-50834f1f865d">12%</measure> of patients had ‡5 CTC/<measure type="value">7.5 ml</measure> <measure type="value"> here (day42</measure>) versus <measure type="list">30%22</measure> (day 30) [9] or <quantifiedObject id="20883342-e08a-4ae6-933b-1a1263e58f84">%</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#20883342-e08a-4ae6-933b-1a1263e58f84"> (day42</measure>-56) [21]. Besides a hypothetical direct anti-CTC effect of bevacizumab, <measure type="value" ptr="#4ca296bf-992c-4b73-ab36-83c9148fc615">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="4ca296bf-992c-4b73-ab36-83c9148fc615">possible explanations</quantifiedObject> should be discussed. First, bevacizumab gained its worldwide regulatory approval after the demonstration of a significant prolongation in PFS, leading to its use as a standard for first-line treatment [2]. Importantly, it is highly probable that the intrinsic properties of CTC positivity, defined by a precise threshold (here, ‡5 CTC/<measure type="value">7.5 ml</measure> was initially tested) and used as an early surrogate test of PFS, will strongly depend on the length of the PFS obtained by treatments, which are continuously improved. In other words, the ‡5 CTC/<measure type="value" ptr="#888d395f-e05b-4688-9f1c-43c6aa3fc169">7.5 ml</measure> threshold which successfully separated early (median: 2.1 months) from late (7.0 months) <quantifiedObject id="888d395f-e05b-4688-9f1c-43c6aa3fc169">progressive disease under</quantifiedObject> standard chemotherapy will necessarily be challenged by the improvement of PFS due to new treatments such as bevacizumab (or trastuzumab, not used here and not reported in the series by Cristofanilli et al.). Accordingly, our results indicate that the CTC positivity threshold should be ‡3 CTC/<measure type="value">7.5 ml</measure> rather than ‡5 CTC/<measure type="value">7.5 ml</measure>, when used for prognostic purpose at baseline in our setting. Secondly, we also suggest that the use of bevacizumab may change the intravasation abilities of cancer cells, due to its effect on the vessels endothelium. For comparison purposes, in colorectal cancer studies, <measure type="list">56%100</measure> and % of patients were treated with bevacizumab in the studies by Cohen et al. (n = <measure type="value">430</measure> patients) [22] and Tol et al. (n = <measure type="value" ptr="#8d96c5dc-7e37-4934-ab0e-74543c97cc37">467</measure> <quantifiedObject id="8d96c5dc-7e37-4934-ab0e-74543c97cc37">patients</quantifiedObject>) [23] studies, respectively. These <measure type="value" ptr="#c9d0a91d-63a8-41da-aaea-cb4f3c5d1eca">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c9d0a91d-63a8-41da-aaea-cb4f3c5d1eca">studies</quantifiedObject> exhibited a similar baseline CTC positivity rate. However, CTC positivity rates reported under treatment were rather different (<measure type="value">12%</measure> versus <measure type="value">5%</measure> at <measure type="interval">5-6 weeks</measure>), inversely correlated with bevacizumab use. Intravasation impairment is a hypothesis to explain why CTC counts dropped off under treatment. This hypothesis may explain how CTC count (i) retains a significant prognostic value at baseline, as already described in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy [24]; but (ii) has less individual significance as an early surrogate marker of TtP when assessed under treatment. The impact of bevacizumab on tumoral vessels has been reported in many ways since the original report of bevacizumab use in rectal cancers [25] but our analysis is the first, to our knowledge, to indicate that it may impair tumor cell intravasation in patients.</p><p>Published data about CECs are highly heterogeneous, obtained by various CEC-sorting techniques, in many different tumor types, and commonly reported in a small sample size [26][27][28]. To further complicate the survey on CECs, these cells can be divided into mature CECs and progenitor CECs, whereas some chemotherapy regimens (metronomic chemotherapy) are believed to exert antiangiogenic effects beyond their cytotoxic effects. More recently, it has also been shown that some standard chemotherapies (especially taxanes) have a stimulating effect on an endothelial progenitor which supports their combined use with an antiangiogenic agent [29]. CEC sorting by the CellSearchÒ system is based on a CD146(+), CD105(+), DAPI (+) and CD45 (2) phenotypes of CECs [17]. It has been also validated through gene expression profiling which verified that expression of endothelial genes such as vascular endothelial cadherin was present in the population of sorted cells [30]. Our analysis is the first to report that CEC count, by the CellSearchÒ automated system, could be a significant early surrogate marker of TtP for breast cancer patients treated by bevacizumab combined with standard chemotherapy. Among many models tested, <measure type="value">three</measure> could be compared in a validation study: (i) a threshold-based model ( ‡20 CEC/<measure type="value" ptr="#ddb49528-cfb4-490f-8242-48ee701b8c41">4 ml</measure>); (ii) a relative variation model (+50%), both using the two CEC counts (baseline and day 42); and (iii) a threshold-<quantifiedObject id="ddb49528-cfb4-490f-8242-48ee701b8c41">based model at</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#a04401d3-d152-41de-ae90-ad538944a2a0"> day42</measure> ( ‡20 CEC/<measure type="value" ptr="#ce33dbda-acea-4880-828d-f5286065be66">4 ml</measure>). Interestingly, the barely lower statistical significance of <quantifiedObject id="947205de-bf53-4fa7-98cb-a6fc0817c824">the nearby thresholds of</quantifiedObject> ‡25 CEC/<measure type="value" ptr="#947205de-bf53-4fa7-98cb-a6fc0817c824">4 ml</measure> and ‡15 CEC/<measure type="value" ptr="#0cd71025-671e-423d-a7f9-56c1a0e96316">4 ml</measure> (P &lt; <measure type="interval">0.05</measure> and P = <measure type="value">0.07</measure>, respectively) strongly indicated that the statistical significance of the ‡20 CEC/<measure type="value" ptr="#5b2451d7-7a12-4b8f-b69b-aca0d8b0d183">4 ml</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5b2451d7-7a12-4b8f-b69b-aca0d8b0d183">threshold</quantifiedObject> was not due to a random multiple testing artifact. Our results are in line with previous reports (using other CEC-sorting techniques) which indicated that tumor progression under antiangiogenic treatment combined with chemotherapy was associated with a significant CEC decrease [28]. In this exploratory, hypothesis-generating study, we did not attempt to establish a combinatory model using both CTC and CEC levels.</p></text>
