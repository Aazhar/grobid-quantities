The speed of sound waves depends slightly on the number of dissolved particles at fixed mass. Precision experiments using the pulse method can be used to follow micellization in a wide concentration range. Densitometry using the mechanical oscillator method is well established since about <measure type="value">2 decades /3</measure>,4/. A new modified version of this instrument allows the determination of the ratio between the damping force and the elastic force of the oscillator. This method can be used to monitor qualitatively the formation and dissociation of gels as will be shown.</p>
	<p>Triblock Copolymers of the type PEO/PPO/PEO (polyethylene oxide / polypropylene oxide / polyethylene oxide) exist in complex states of aggregation in aqueous solution depending on the relative block sizes. Monomers, micelles and larger aggregates coexist in relative proportions that depend on temperature and concentration. The presently used material (designated Pluronics P-85) has a monomeric molecular weight of <measure type="value">4600</measure> (PE02,/PP03,/PE0,,) purified by Serren Hvidt (Roskilde, Denmark) to remove PEO/PPO dimers. This system has allready been studied by dynamic and static light scattering and oscillatory shear measurements /5/.</p>
	<p>These experiments showed a transition from a mostly monomeric state at low temperatures to a micellar solution at about <measure type="value">2 0 " ~</measure> decreasing with concentration. This transition is difficult to measure with increasing concentration by means of scattering techniques due to increasing interparticle interaction. At concentrations higher than <measure type="interval" ptr="#3f719053-15a7-4bcd-b7bc-7851d4967066" pos="left">25</measure><quantifiedObject id="3f719053-15a7-4bcd-b7bc-7851d4967066">%</quantifiedObject> (W/W) and <quantifiedObject id="b724056a-fa1e-4ffc-9db9-aa66b00382be">temperatures of</quantifiedObject> about <measure type="value" ptr="#b724056a-fa1e-4ffc-9db9-aa66b00382be" pos="right">35'C</measure> there is a sharp transition from the micellar phase to a solid-like glass-clear gel. At higher temperatures the gel "dissolves" again. The transitions to and from the gel state are accompanied by extreme changes in viscosity. It will be shown in the following that the formation of micelles can be followed in a wide concentration range by measurements of the speed of sound waves (pulses). The formation of the gel phase can be detected by densitometry with the advantage of negligible energy input into the sample (compared with oscillatory shear experiments).</p>
	<p>The speed of sound wave (SSW) is a function of the adiabatic compressibility and the density of the fluid /6/. The compressibility of solutions is a function of the tempera-ture and of the solute properties. The speed of sound can be measured with high precision utilizing the pulse mode. The time required for <quantifiedObject id="6e2229ba-5651-48b0-b54e-41638919e355">a short pulse</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#6e2229ba-5651-48b0-b54e-41638919e355" pos="right">170 ns</measure>) to run trough a well defined sample cell (total volume <measure type="value">2ml</measure>) is used to calculate the speed with <quantifiedObject id="fcbb7975-60cc-4baf-b7a6-62d17a92ddc9">an accuracy of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#fcbb7975-60cc-4baf-b7a6-62d17a92ddc9" pos="right">+1 mjs</measure> (DSA 48, Anton Paar K.G. Graz, Austria). The speed of sound at low concentrations is linearly depending on the JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE IV amount of solute in the solution. In addition there is a further dependence on the number of particles in the solution at fixed concentration. So it is possible to follow the hydrolisis of sucrose into glucose and fructose. This pseudo first order reaction leads to an exponential decrease of the concentration of sucrose. In a logarithmic plot the data points should fit a straight line. As shown in Fig.1, this inversion can nicely be followed by SSW measurements. This increase of the speed of sound with increasing particle number is the starting point for the micellization studies using SSW experiments, as the number of particles is significantly reduced during micellization. The dependence of the speed on the particle number is very small. We therefore use the specific speed S, of these waves:</p>
	<p>The dependence of S' on the temperature T for a sucrose solution (<measure type="value" ptr="#e66feee2-842e-4520-b97e-aae55c058759" pos="left">10%</measure> W/<quantifiedObject id="e66feee2-842e-4520-b97e-aae55c058759">W</quantifiedObject>) and a P-85 solution (<measure type="value" ptr="#98ec9e4c-db9b-4551-8e7f-4539f8272156" pos="left">5%</measure> W/<quantifiedObject id="98ec9e4c-db9b-4551-8e7f-4539f8272156">W</quantifiedObject>) is shown in F i g . 2 .</p>
	<p>F+g. 2: Change of the specific speed of sound waves S' as a functlon of the temperature T for <measure type="list">10%5</measure> sucrose (xxx) and % P-85 (+++).</p>
	<p>The solution with sucrose shows a monotonically decreasing behaviour, i. e., there is only a slight change of the specific speed with temperature. The curve for the P-85 solution is quite different. It matches the sucrose curve only at low and high temperatures. Deviations from the temperature behavior of sucrose starting at about <measure type="interval">20</measure>aC, show a clear maximum (highest micelle formation rate) at <measure type="value">29'C</measure> and vanish at about <measure type="value">45'C</measure>. This indicates that the formation of micelles essentially starts at <measure type="interval" ptr="#ab3179cf-e7e6-4b21-98e9-4df2d793ce95" pos="right">20°C and is finished at 45°C</measure> with a maximum in the formation rate at <measure type="value">29°C</measure>. We can also see from this figure that the magnitude of the effects depend on the chosen sample. We get a much higher signal for a <measure type="value" ptr="#ac08d82f-0bcb-4642-8d5f-aee7a2019266" pos="left">5%</measure> P-<quantifiedObject id="ac08d82f-0bcb-4642-8d5f-aee7a2019266">85 solution</quantifiedObject> than for a <measure type="value">10%</measure> sucrose solution.</p>
	<p>The influence of a varying concentration of P-85 is given in the F i g s . 3 and 4 . The signal has been divided by the concentration in order to scale the curves. From F i g . 3 we can see that the maximum formation rate of micelles is shifted from <measure type="interval" ptr="#16c024cb-154b-47dc-a7ed-33a7b2ad9099" pos="left">26'C10</measure> at <quantifiedObject id="16c024cb-154b-47dc-a7ed-33a7b2ad9099">%</quantifiedObject> to <measure type="interval">15'C</measure> at <measure type="value">30%</measure>. We also see the nonlinearity of the effect for concentrations higher than <measure type="interval" ptr="#a5e609d5-29f2-420e-a461-99db20bccc9d" pos="left">20</measure><quantifiedObject id="a5e609d5-29f2-420e-a461-99db20bccc9d">%</quantifiedObject> P-85. With decreasing concentration we have a constantly decreasing signal with an increase of the relative error. The effect of micellization can be measured nicely at concentrations as small as <measure type="value">0.5%</measure> (see Fig. 4). We have performed experiments at even lower concentrations. There is still a significant peak at the micellization temperature, but more sophisticated data manipulations (smoothing) and repeated experiments would be necessary at <quantifiedObject id="b55bacc6-1672-4ed1-8333-dd76529e49f4">concentrations lower</quantifiedObject> than <measure type="interval" ptr="#b55bacc6-1672-4ed1-8333-dd76529e49f4" pos="right">0.5%</measure>.</p>
	<p>Precision densitometry uses the mechanical oscillator method / 3 , 4 / . This method is based on the measurement of the eigenfrequency of a Ushaped glass tube filled with the sample. In the standard setup (DMA 58, A. PAAR K.G., Graz, Aus-tria) the external force is of the same amplitude as the damping force but phase shifted by <measure type="value">180 degrees</measure> to maintain steady oscillation. Such a mechanically driven oscillation can be represented by the external force F , and the following <measure type="value" ptr="#ac51e20c-54c0-4c7a-9fa0-20c0ca24fe42" pos="left">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="ac51e20c-54c0-4c7a-9fa0-20c0ca24fe42">internal forces</quantifiedObject>: the elastic spring force which is proportional to the dislocation x of the mass cx (c is the spring constant), the damping force (energy absorbing) which is proportional to the velocity x' of the mass bx' (b is the damping constant) and the mass force which is proportio-nal to the acceleration mx" of the mass m of the system /7/. The external force F , must compensate the damping force, i.e., it must be equal to -bx'. Such a system with synchronized external force will perform a steady harmonic oscillation with a dislocation This situation is visualized in Fig. 5. We call this operation mode, where the external force is balancing the damping force, in phase mode. Here we are not further interested in the well known details of densitometry, but we have to discuss the modifications that allow the qualitative determination of the damping force (viscosity) with such a densitometer. Actually it can be shown that it is possible to measure the ratio between the damping force and the spring force utilizing a second experiment with a phase shifted mode. In this mode the external force Fen is shifted by <measure type="value">45 degrees</measure>. The amplitude is increased so that -."C;1 the component in direction of the damping force remains constant (see In this mode we observe a different frequency a , or period T,. Combining the <measure type="value">two</measure> corresponding differential equations we get</p>
	<p>We see that the ratio D<quantifiedObject id="561c0e8a-0c94-4187-ab0a-0530e0160a1f">R between t</quantifiedObject>he damping force and the spring force is simply related to the oscillating periods. This function runs through a maximum at r]' (see Fig. 7) and goes to <measure type="value" ptr="#561c0e8a-0c94-4187-ab0a-0530e0160a1f" pos="right">zero</measure> at high values of r ] , where the fluid is no longer streaming in the tube but acts like a stiff rod. The value v* is about <measure type="value">100 mPa.s</measure> in the basic mode (or fundamental mode, frequency w,) of the oscillator. The maximum 7' can be shifted to about <measure type="value">600 mPa.s</measure> if the first order mode oscillation (frequency ul) of the tube is excited, but this does not change the situation essentially. This means that this technique is not suited to "measure" viscosity qualitatively in a wide range. We have to keep in mind these facts when we discuss the results from gelation data, where the viscosity increases in a sharp transition over many orders of magnitude. The advantage of the densitometer method lies in the facts that only a small amount of <quantifiedObject id="3b990eee-86f4-4f8e-b0ff-56e5a9f9eb90">sample</quantifiedObject> ( * <measure type="value" ptr="#3b990eee-86f4-4f8e-b0ff-56e5a9f9eb90" pos="right">1 ml</measure>) is simply filled in a well thermostated and closed glass tube and that only a negligible energy input into the sample takes place (extremely low shear strain). More difficult is the relation between this ratio (mostly depending on the damping force with a quasi constant spring force) and the viscosity r ] . There is a linear dependence for small values of fi .</p>
	<p>The P-85 solution is a fluid with low viscosity at low temperatures and at low concentrations. At concentrations lower than <measure type="interval">20%</measure> W/W there is a weak temperature dependence up to <measure type="interval">60'C</measure> as we can see from Fig. 8 for experiments using basic mode oscillation. The damping ratio (the values for water have been subtracted) decreases slightly from <measure type="value">5'C</measure> up to at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#5f52d515-0f3f-4690-b80d-1a925ec1c5fe" pos="right">60</measure>°C. Then follows a constant increase up to <quantifiedObject id="10b453a4-86e7-4949-bd74-fdeb5183de75">the maximum measured temperature from</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#10b453a4-86e7-4949-bd74-fdeb5183de75" pos="right">70 to 78°C</measure>. A gel phase with moderate viscosity exists in this high temperature regime and the transition is not sharp. This behaviour is also found by oscillatory shear experiments.</p>

The width of this regime increases with concentration. If we take for example a concentration of <measure type="value">25%</measure>, we see a slight increase of <quantifiedObject id="36268860-e1e4-4948-989e-9cddfd066414">the damping ratio</quantifiedObject> (i.e. viscosity) between <measure type="interval" ptr="#36268860-e1e4-4948-989e-9cddfd066414" pos="right">20'C and 30'C</measure>.

It has such a high viscosity ( 7 &gt;&gt; 7 ' ) that the damping ratio is smaller than the one for water (negative values).
