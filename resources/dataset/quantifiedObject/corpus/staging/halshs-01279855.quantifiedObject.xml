	<p>The Tour de France is one the world"s largest sports events. The <measure type="value" ptr="#123">three-week</measure> <quantifiedObject id="123">race</quantifiedObject> attracts <measure type="interval" ptr="#spectators1">10 to 15 million</measure> (non-paying) <quantifiedObject id="spectators1">spectators</quantifiedObject> along the roads each year and individual stages are watched by <measure type="interval" ptr="#tvViewers1">15 to 20 million</measure> <quantifiedObject id="tvViewers1">TV viewers</quantifiedObject> worldwide (see chapter 5). Although generally cycling races are not lucrative, the Tour de France organiser"s balance sheet reveals that the Tour has always been profitable in the past <measure type="interval">two decades</measure>.</p>
	<p>How can this attractiveness and the economic success story be explained? Most sports economists are used to turn to a contest"s outcome uncertainty as a first explanatory variable for success. However, fans of the Tour de France are not often surprised by the name of the final winner of the race, usually not even by the <measure type="value" ptr="#fd38fc22-c63a-4314-9fa3-be46ddcf2893">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="fd38fc22-c63a-4314-9fa3-be46ddcf2893">riders</quantifiedObject> sharing the podium. Nobody needs more than a few riders" names to predict with great certainty who the winner will be. Thus, explaining Tour de France success by outcome uncertainty and its usual metrics in terms of competitive balance must be checked carefully.</p>
	<p>The Tour de France is managed by Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO). ASO also organises other professional cycling races (such as Paris-Roubaix or the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré) as well as golf tournaments, track and field events, car races and horse-riding contests. Professional road cycling accounts for close to <measure type="value" ptr="#84a714b2-b329-4e52-a177-fb3db491c07d">70%</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="84a714b2-b329-4e52-a177-fb3db491c07d">ASO revenue</quantifiedObject>, mainly because of the success of the Tour de France (Desbordes, 2006). Since ASO is a privately-owned company, it aims at profit maximising and designs its strategy accordingly. A first strategic tool consists in multiplying the number of trophies within a race. This process started up in <measure type="interval">1919 with introducing the yellow jersey and lasted until 1989</measure> when the number of trophies has nearly stabilised, respectively rewarding the best rider overall (yellow jersey), the best climber (polka-dot jersey), the best sprinter (green jersey), the best young rider (any rider aged below <measure type="interval">25</measure>, white jersey), and the best-ranked team. From time to time other trophies appeared and vanished again after <measure type="value">some years</measure>. By creating "different races within the race", ASO attempted and succeeded in making the Tour de France a more vivid contest with multiple opportunities for duels between riders or teams competing for a given trophy and changes in the tactics adopted by riders or teams during the course of the race.</p>
	<p><measure type="value" ptr="#b14dfc10-889f-46d0-8235-6aeaed6895bd">Two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b14dfc10-889f-46d0-8235-6aeaed6895bd">other factors</quantifiedObject> that attract people to see riders on the Tour de France roads are linked together. The first one is the riders" performance, the second one lies in the hardness of the race. Based on the number of racing days and the number of rest days per racing day, the Tour de France became much harder after the <measure type="interval">1920s</measure> with the <quantifiedObject id="b83946ea-0a8b-4dba-98f7-021798691160">number of racing days</quantifiedObject> stabilising up to about <measure type="value" ptr="#b83946ea-0a8b-4dba-98f7-021798691160">20</measure> while <measure type="value" ptr="#b83946ea-0a8b-4dba-98f7-021798691161">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b83946ea-0a8b-4dba-98f7-021798691161">rest day</quantifiedObject> per <measure type="value" ptr="#ten1">ten</measure> <quantifiedObject id="ten1">racing days</quantifiedObject> became the usual ratio. Before the <measure type="interval">1920s</measure> the <quantifiedObject id="c283b527-133f-4167-8a47-bbbfa3475e43">number of stages</quantifiedObject> was usually <measure type="interval" ptr="#c283b527-133f-4167-8a47-bbbfa3475e43">15</measure> at most and the riders enjoyed at least <measure id="#one1" type="interval">one day</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="one1">rest</quantifiedObject> after each stage. The overall <quantifiedObject id="riding_distance">riding distance</quantifiedObject> was <measure type="value" id="#riding_distance">2,428 kilometers</measure> in <measure type="value">1903</measure> and rose to a maximum of <measure type="interval">5,745 kilometers</measure> in <measure type="value">1926</measure>. Since then the <quantifiedObject id="9428d378-47d1-4e32-a4d7-73c9093870ca">distance</quantifiedObject> shortened to about <measure type="value" ptr="#9428d378-47d1-4e32-a4d7-73c9093870ca">3,500 kilometers</measure> on average. Thus, compared with the initial era of so-called "road"s convicts" (les forçats de la route in French), riders now spend more days on the roads and have less often time to rest. However, this has been made feasible by reducing the average <quantifiedObject id="stage_length">stage length</quantifiedObject> from over <measure ptr="#stage_length" type="value">300 kilometers</measure> until <measure type="interval">1926</measure> to less than <measure type="interval">200 kilometers</measure> since the <measure type="interval">1960s</measure>. Consequently, the <quantifiedObject id="average_duration_stage">average duration of a stage</quantifiedObject>, i.e. the time actually spent by riders on their bikes, fell from <measure type="interval" ptr="#average_duration_stage">10 to 16 hours</measure> before the <measure type="interval">1930s</measure> to slightly over <measure type="value">4 hours</measure> in the <measure type="interval">2000s</measure>. The race also became harder due to the introduction of mountain stages. The first mountain ever climbed in the Tour de France was the Ballon d"Alsace in the Vosges region in <measure type="value">1905</measure>. A <measure type="value">handful of years</measure> later, high-mountain stages in the Pyrenees (<measure type="value">1910</measure>) and the Alps (<measure type="value">1911</measure>) were introduced. However, the <quantifiedObject id="0f7619d2-8517-45aa-9846-6b42c9a959f9">number of passes</quantifiedObject> over <measure type="value" ptr="#0f7619d2-8517-45aa-9846-6b42c9a959f9">1,000 meters</measure> in a given Tour de France has not increased significantly on average since the <measure type="value">1920s</measure>.</p>

	<p>Apart from the physical hardness of the Tour de France, it is also the increase in riders" performances that has made the Tour attractive to spectators. The overall average speed of the yellow jersey winner was between <measure type="interval">25 and 30 kilometers per hour (km/h</measure>) until the late <measure type="value">1930s</measure>. Since World War II it has steadily increased. From <measure type="interval">25.7</measure> km/h in <measure type="value">1903</measure> to <measure type="interval">41.7 km/h</measure> in <measure type="value">2005</measure> (the fastest Tour ever) is an improvement of <measure type="value">62%</measure>. Part of this acceleration is due to technical progress affecting riders" bikes such as the introduction of derailleur gears, the increase in the number of gears, lighter bikes, profiled wheels, etc. (Calvet, 1981;Andreff, 1985). Improvement of the road surface, shorter stages, multiple stakes and high effort intensity in the crucial parts of the race have also triggered both higher rider performance and increased attractiveness to spectators. Improved physical and medical preparation, better nutrition, and sometimes doping may have played a role as well. Another index of riders" performance is the withdrawal ratio, the percentage of riders who do not finish all stages of the Tour Last but not least, the Tour de France is a sports event that is supplied for free to <measure type="value" ptr="#33663bc7-f5d3-4e48-9ccb-70ff4ab37047">millions</measure> of spectators along the roads. However, the demand for it is not infinite. The demand is rationed by various constraints such as the date and location of a stage or the hosting capacity of a geographical site (like the slopes of the Mont Ventoux or Alpe d"Huez), limiting the number of spectators. Nevertheless, from an economic point of view, a free sport event is likely to draw a huge attendance. Indeed, <measure type="interval" ptr="#dc445c0a-c031-4ae6-b30f-df538bc96328">10 to 15 million</measure> <quantifiedObject id="dc445c0a-c031-4ae6-b30f-df538bc96328">spectators per</quantifiedObject> year attend the race over <quantifiedObject id="21e76c2b-873d-463d-979e-b653770ae80d">the course of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#21e76c2b-873d-463d-979e-b653770ae80d">three weeks</measure>. This is significantly more than the biggest mega-sporting event in the world, the FIFA World Cup with an attendance of <measure type="value" ptr="#e0036191-7abd-40d1-b6bd-61871dce703d">3,115,800</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e0036191-7abd-40d1-b6bd-61871dce703d">people</quantifiedObject> in Germany 2006 and <measure type="list" ptr="#8e93ed7d-6059-4cbe-b23c-862a57287238">3</measure>,224,342 in South Africa 2010. Moreover, since all spectators cannot attend the Tour <measure type="value">21 days</measure> long, they also demand a story telling which was first supplied by newspapers, then through radio broadcasts and eventually through TV broadcasts.</p>
	<p>The Tour de France has not always been a profitable business. Until the <measure type="value">1950s</measure>, financial deficits were common (Reed, 2010). The deficits vanished with rising TV rights revenues. The first Tour de France TV broadcast was the finish of the last stage at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris in <measure type="value">1948</measure> whereas the first TV broadcast of a mountain pass was at the Aubisque in <measure type="value">1958</measure>. Nowadays, the Tour is the major sports event in the French broadcasting market with well over <measure type="interval" ptr="#798d7afd-f992-43c6-af9c-a89e0f126401">80</measure> <quantifiedObject id="798d7afd-f992-43c6-af9c-a89e0f126401">hours of</quantifiedObject> broadcast, ahead of <quantifiedObject id="478c39c6-beb6-4df1-bcde-a8bc242f9719">the Roland Garros tennis tournament</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#478c39c6-beb6-4df1-bcde-a8bc242f9719">77 hours</measure>), Champions League matches, Formula 1 races and the rugby <measure type="value">Six</measure> nations tournament. In <measure type="value">2013</measure>, <measure type="value">24 million</measure> French people watched the Tour de France for at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#4cc14010-9c4b-4474-9009-c3896bc427c1">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="4cc14010-9c4b-4474-9009-c3896bc427c1">hour</quantifiedObject> on French television, a TV market share of slightly over <measure type="value">30%</measure>. In chapter 5 it was explained how from the <measure type="interval" ptr="#f6899c4b-fab1-45e6-ae51-b9817bd6f90c">1970s</measure> on the Tour de France was also broadcast in more and more countries.</p>
	<p>Today it is a global mega-sporting event. Over <measure type="interval">100</measure> TV channels in <measure type="value" ptr="#e3086ede-beb0-4518-9ace-723108f3f6f4">190</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e3086ede-beb0-4518-9ace-723108f3f6f4">countries</quantifiedObject> now broadcast the (Andreff &amp; Staudohar, 2000). In the MCMMG model, media, in particular through TV broadcasting rights, have become a significant source of income for many sports. Furthermore, alongside with sponsors and gate receipts (spectators) whose share in overall finance of sports events has shrunk, new sources of finance have emerged including corporations (investment funds, big companies, Russian oligarchs, Middle Eastern sheiks enriched by oil sales, …), merchandising of non sporting goods (e.g. T-shirts) under a club"s or a player"s label, and markets. With respect to the latter, we see that money is channeled into contemporary professional sports from <measure type="value" ptr="#bdffd579-a2ad-43d6-806c-fe173224cf6a">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="bdffd579-a2ad-43d6-806c-fe173224cf6a">markets</quantifiedObject>: a labour market for talent in which a club makes money in selling home-educated and trained talented players and a capital market that enables to trade a club"s shares at the stock exchange and collecting money from the fans as shareholders. Most of these new sources of finance are global.</p>
	<p>From table 1 we also see that although the current Tour de France financing model is in line with big professional sports leagues such as the football English Premier League and the French Ligue 1, it remains specific in a way too. For example, its TV-dependence is slightly lower in percentage of overall revenues compared to football and merchandising and <quantifiedObject id="00836407-6c61-4483-b87a-d33b6def2a66">sponsorship</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#00836407-6c61-4483-b87a-d33b6def2a66">51%</measure>) is still a more important source of income to the Tour de France organisers than TV rights revenues. This may be interpreted as either the Tour de France being in a transition phase between the SSSL and MCMMG models, or as a consequence of the absence of gate revenue which must be compensated for by sponsorship money. In fact, the lack of gate revenue potentially deprives the Tour de France of up to <measure type="value">a quarter</measure> (like in English football) of overall revenues. The share of public money received from municipalities is more important in the Tour de France than in European football though it is now reduced to <measure type="value">5%</measure> only. At the end of the day, the profitability of the Tour de France is likely to be guaranteed as long as it will attract media, advertisers and sponsors even without any spectatorship income.</p>
	<p>a/ When <measure type="value" ptr="#a7790828-2760-42c1-9054-9516879258e9">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a7790828-2760-42c1-9054-9516879258e9">competitor</quantifiedObject> has a very high capacity to win, the tournament practically is without interest for other participants who will dedicate only a minimal effort. The organiser must avoid such a competitive imbalance.</p>
	<p> <measure type="interval">As ASO indeed aims at making a profit from organising the Tour de France, the choice of an appropriate incentive mechanism is crucial. Most of the prerequisites for a successful and attractive France each year. As described in chapter 2, this is not without conflicting interests between the organisers of the "grand tours" (ASO, RCS and Unipublic) and the UCI claiming that all the Pro Tour teams must be invited in each "grand tour" (Rebeggiani &amp; Tondani, 2008). Total prize money in the Tour de France is now over €2 million</measure> (for a detailed analysis, see chapter 3) which, compared with other cycling races, is rather fulfilling the prerequisite (b). Since the prize money is distributed over multiple trophies, condition (e) is satisfied as well. Only condition (a) is debatable when one witnesses a rider winning the Tour de France <measure type="value" ptr="#acce772c-317b-4bd8-acb9-8d38d840fd1d">five</measure> <quantifiedObject id="acce772c-317b-4bd8-acb9-8d38d840fd1d">times</quantifiedObject> like Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, or, in the case of the later disqualified Lance Armstrong, <measure type="value" ptr="#14f011a4-01b8-41ca-b7dc-8c26c6b88651">seven</measure> <quantifiedObject id="14f011a4-01b8-41ca-b7dc-8c26c6b88651">times in</quantifiedObject> a row.</p>
	<p>Condition (a) is not valid either when the yellow jersey winner is too <quantifiedObject id="69927f60-3a81-482a-a092-96a582026bd0">much ahead of</quantifiedObject> the secondranked rider, like in <measure type="value" ptr="#69927f60-3a81-482a-a092-96a582026bd0">1952</measure> when Fausto Coppi won the Tour de France with a lead of over <measure type="interval" ptr="#60a44ec4-6332-40b8-901a-f87b92cc5cff">28</measure> <quantifiedObject id="60a44ec4-6332-40b8-901a-f87b92cc5cff">minutes</quantifiedObject>.</p>
	<p>In fact, condition (a) raises the issue of competitive balance in the Tour de France which is discussed in section 2 below. Finally, prerequisite (f) refers to the distribution of Tour de France prize money across different trophies and best-ranked riders. In the <measure type="value">2014</measure> Tour de France, for every lower position in the general classification the prize money was more or less halved between the first <measure type="value" ptr="#4e8a8af4-5e88-45c7-a813-101297542cc1">seven</measure> <quantifiedObject id="4e8a8af4-5e88-45c7-a813-101297542cc1">ranked riders</quantifiedObject> <measure type="list" ptr="#956bf06d-b525-4cb7-a522-8808953575b3">: from €450,000 for the winner over € 200,000 for the runner-up to € 100,000 for the third ranked rider, and so on to € 11,500</measure> for the rider ranked in seventh place. A similar gap is assessed as a strong effort incentive in most individual sports tournaments such as, for example, tennis. With this incentive prize structure a rider who jumps from the seventh to the fifth rank multiplies his financial gains by <measure type="value">four</measure> and the same occurs when a rider jumps from the third to the first place. The prize structure for winning a stage is similar with also approximately a doubling of the monetary reward for <measure type="value">one</measure> rank improvement between the <measure type="value" ptr="#90cf40d0-49ea-48b0-9b65-0893ff68293d">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="90cf40d0-49ea-48b0-9b65-0893ff68293d">best ranked riders</quantifiedObject>. The prize structure for the other trophies is less in tune with tournament theory. In the race for the green, the white and the polka-dot jerseys, financial gains are not doubled when a rider improves his rank by <measure type="value">one</measure> <measure type="list">. These trophies thus clearly have a less incentive prize structure. If one ASO objective is to "multiply the races within the race" this must not go as far as disturbing the contention for the yellow jersey. That is the reason why incentives are significantly lower (€25,000 for the green and polka-dot jersey winners, € 20,000</measure> for the white jersey winner) and less structured according to the tournament theory for trophies that only appeal to specialised riders like sprinters or climbers.</p>
	<p>Outcome uncertainty is at the heart of sports economics (Rottenberg, 1956;Neale, 1964). When a big gap between the aggregated players" talent of <measure type="value" ptr="#30d4ecd1-1313-41a5-99b8-431be5c833c8">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="30d4ecd1-1313-41a5-99b8-431be5c833c8">teams</quantifiedObject> is witnessed, there is a quite low probability to win for <measure type="value" ptr="#91f86f6c-2483-4ffd-a157-cdbf0a78a6fe">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="91f86f6c-2483-4ffd-a157-cdbf0a78a6fe">team</quantifiedObject> while the other is nearly certain of winning. In such a case, outcome uncertainty is negligible and the game exhibits a competitive imbalance or a weak competitive balance. If, by chance and as it happens sometimes, the underdog defeats the favourite team, the outcome will be assessed as a "surprise". However, the notion of a surprising sporting outcome is still in the cradle (M. &amp; W. Andreff, 2014). A similar approach is used to assess the outcome uncertainty of a sport contest or a sports league. Sports economists often assume and then attempt demonstrating that a balanced sport contest or game does attract big audiences while a low attendance signals a weak competitive balance.</p>
	<p>This view has been mitigated in recent years. A distinction between <measure type="value" ptr="#8e5b0b4f-b519-4e5f-a602-8b6018ec1aaf">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="8e5b0b4f-b519-4e5f-a602-8b6018ec1aaf">types of</quantifiedObject> sport s<quantifiedObject id="2c5ded0c-882d-42c5-8dff-458c2bdb2023">how </quantifiedObject>consumers has been successfully tested. On the one hand, fans and season ticket holders basically expect the greatest possible number of wins from their favourite team and thus care less about competitive balance. On the other hand, TV viewers and casual spectators often care less about the winning team and are attracted by more balanced games. For example, for NBA basketball it has been shown that fans wish at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#2c5ded0c-882d-42c5-8dff-458c2bdb2023">two-thirds</measure> of wins for their favourite team (Rascher &amp; Solmes, 2007).</p>
	<p>Taking the audience interest as a benchmark, the Tour de France would definitely be considered to be a well-balanced competition given its <measure type="interval" ptr="#a6141b65-5c3a-409e-b327-fde7fec3ff15">10 to 15 million</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a6141b65-5c3a-409e-b327-fde7fec3ff15">people attendance</quantifiedObject>. But since this sport show is offered for free, such a conclusion might be misleading. If one wants to really test the concept of competitive balance, a next issue is to develop an accurate metrics. With team sports, the theoretically best competitive balance for a game is when both teams have a <measure type="value">50%</measure> probability of winning. The most used proxy for this probability consists of comparing the win percentages of the <measure type="value" ptr="#60fd715a-8154-4043-b036-5bb50c403a85">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="60fd715a-8154-4043-b036-5bb50c403a85">teams</quantifiedObject> and, for the league as a whole, of designing some sort of win dispersion or concentration indices (Andreff, 2012;Groot, 2008), the most famous being the Noll-Scully index. These indices are static as they pertain to just <measure type="value" ptr="#01817eae-bd22-4845-8231-d5f58a041dbb">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="01817eae-bd22-4845-8231-d5f58a041dbb">game or</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#7ec69b26-11b9-40d9-8823-d4608fdcb99f">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="7ec69b26-11b9-40d9-8823-d4608fdcb99f">season</quantifiedObject>. A dynamic competitive balance index refers to <measure type="value" ptr="#23027883-3544-43ab-9547-1152022264e2">several</measure> <quantifiedObject id="23027883-3544-43ab-9547-1152022264e2">seasons</quantifiedObject> in a row or, in the case of Tour de France, to <measure type="value">several consecutive years</measure>. Usually dynamic competitive balance is measured by looking at a rank correlation coefficient across seasons.</p>
	<p>The only (albeit serious) problem with aforementioned indices is that just like any other cycling race, the Tour de France is not a bilateral confrontation between <measure type="value" ptr="#ddf11788-2226-4bd2-9d43-e7b40c48326c">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="ddf11788-2226-4bd2-9d43-e7b40c48326c">teams or</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#d6fe6e12-cac2-4053-8b6f-f7a4141f44a8">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d6fe6e12-cac2-4053-8b6f-f7a4141f44a8">riders and</quantifiedObject> the competitive balance indexes for team sports league thus cannot be applied as such. One cannot derive and calculate a win percentage between, for example, Team Sky and Movistar from their performances in previous cycling races since their sporting outcomes are not the result of a bilateral confrontation but of an overall series of contests with many other cycling teams. Since it is not possible to define bilateral win percentages, another metrics has to be developed. This is all the more the case because road cycling is at the same time an individual sport and a team sport. There is just <measure type="value" ptr="#e4b84f8b-eba4-44d9-a287-7360912e7d64">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e4b84f8b-eba4-44d9-a287-7360912e7d64">yellow jersey winner but</quantifiedObject> all riders are grouped into teams and no one can win the yellow jersey without the work and effort from his teammates. Moreover, given the multiple trophies that are at stake, <measure type="interval" ptr="#c2eeed9a-e24f-4aba-89c1-3fdc1f5fd7c4">two</measure> or more <quantifiedObject id="c2eeed9a-e24f-4aba-89c1-3fdc1f5fd7c4">teams</quantifiedObject> often divide labour and co-operate (sometimes collude) in view of winning a specific trophy.</p>

Although this leads to the impression that the Tour is very imbalanced, the conclusion relies on the performance of only <measure type="value" ptr="#3b39f6bf-81d0-43a8-93b9-5cefe285a11a">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="3b39f6bf-81d0-43a8-93b9-5cefe285a11a">rider</quantifiedObject>, making it even less robust than above. Nevertheless, it means that one feature often associated with outcome uncertainty, namely an unforeseeable sporting result (Neale, 1964) is missing or really weak in Tour de France.</p>
	<p>A common limitation to all previous indexes is that they assess competitive balance only on the basis of <measure type="list" ptr="#4e619a06-2d27-4c9b-9966-248b897950e5">one</measure> or two <quantifiedObject id="4e619a06-2d27-4c9b-9966-248b897950e5">riders</quantifiedObject> or, at maximum, of a small number of riders in contention for the yellow jersey as with Mignot"s jersey switching index. They give neither any idea of a team"s strength nor of the overall dispersion or concentration of strengths in the peloton. One step further therefore is to find a ranking during the pre-Tour de France cycling season that may represent the respective strengths of different teams. Rogge et al. (2013), when testing the efficiency of Tour de France cycling teams, used the number of cycling quotient (CQ) points obtained by the riders selected for the Tour de France as earned on the eve of the Tour. Individual CQ rider values collected from the CQ website (www.cqranking.com) are subsequently aggregated into a team score. In the same vein, a calculation of cumulative points obtained for the UCI ranking on the eve of the Tour by a team"s selected riders has been used for approximating the collective strength of this team (Andreff, 2014b Remind that the famous Noll-Scully index compares the actual standard deviation of win percentages to a theoretical optimal one, the best possible competitive balance when all teams have à <measure type="value">50%</measure> (14) -<measure type="interval">0.14</measure> (16) <measure type="value">0.14</measure> (19) <measure type="value">0.10</measure> (22) Between brackets: the number of teams common between <measure type="value">two</measure> Tours de France *** significant at <measure type="value">1%</measure>; ** significant at <measure type="value">5%</measure>; * significant at <measure type="value">10%</measure></p>
	<p>This leads to a major conclusion. When <measure type="value">multiple years</measure> are considered, the Tour de France generally shows a dynamic competitive balance, with uncertainty and unpredictability. However, when just <measure type="value" ptr="#9093d8b9-734e-4f4d-8d7e-475d3f21620a">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="9093d8b9-734e-4f4d-8d7e-475d3f21620a">Tour</quantifiedObject> is considered, the Tour de France rather exhibits a static imbalance. This implies that in the course of the race it is rather predictable what teams will perform the best, but from one Tour to the other the outcome is much more unpredictable due to team changes, team recruitment, the selection of riders for the next Tour, and the resulting team performance. One could therefore conclude that although each Tour is a new story, for each story the scenario is rather well known to the spectators.</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, the Tour still attracts <measure type="value">tens of millions</measure> of people along the roads and in front of television sets. This confirms earlier observations in sports economics research that questioned the importance of competitive balance as the main determinant of viewership interest for a sports event.</p>
	<p>The Tour de France success story has not been disturbed too much so far by its long-lasting association with doping, not even by <quantifiedObject id="cb23ef52-46a8-4d45-b2b7-85d0a9a4f5c9">the doping troubles of</quantifiedObject> the past <measure type="value" ptr="#cb23ef52-46a8-4d45-b2b7-85d0a9a4f5c9">decade</measure>. Does this mean that doping has no impact on the Tour outcome? Or that fans and spectators are unaware of doping? Or that the anti-doping combat has become so effective that doping use is actually on its way down within the peloton? Doping in cycling is discussed in detail in chapter 13. An introduction to doping in the Tour de France and an innovative procedure to better deal with the use of doping is presented below.</p>
	<p>As a consequence, the above used competitive balance indexes as well as the analyses of sporting success determinants (Torgler, 2007) or team efficiency (Rogge et al., 2013) in the Tour de France, are for certain distorted to an unknown extent. In fact, they do not include an explanatory or dummy variable supposed to capture the doping effect on rider and team performances. For example, the estimated probability to be ranked among the first <measure type="value">25</measure> riders for the yellow jersey trophy calculated by</p>
	<p>A new analytical approach to doping in sports economics relies on game theory. The starting point is to basically assume that riders dope themselves because it corresponds to their deeply rooted economic and financial interests, and not because they are bad by nature, professional cheaters or criminals. <measure type="value" ptr="#f0c65602-5ae1-4c57-b01a-aa10906ee1b7">Two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="f0c65602-5ae1-4c57-b01a-aa10906ee1b7">papers written</quantifiedObject> in the wake of the Festina scandal (Eber &amp;Thépot, 1999 andBerentsen, 2002) analyse doping as a result of a prisoner"s dilemma, one of the most famous problems in game theory. In a nutshell, the doping game is a prisoner"s dilemma adapted here to cycling where: a/ there is a (financial and health) cost borne by riders when they use doping; b/ the use of doping substances and techniques enables a rider to enhance his performances; c/ if, in an assumed <measure type="value" ptr="#8f546945-7ca2-4e9f-a9cf-87019cbf6c28">two</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="8f546945-7ca2-4e9f-a9cf-87019cbf6c28">rider race</quantifiedObject>, both riders dope the final ranking remains unchanged compared to a situation without doping; and d/ if one of the <measure type="value" ptr="#b7bd3e27-c3d7-4c88-8b34-071c31496213">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b7bd3e27-c3d7-4c88-8b34-071c31496213">riders</quantifiedObject> is caught, he will never denounce the other rider for being doped as well. Cycling the latter behaviour is known as omerta or the "law of silence": it is forbidden to openly talk about doping. In such a prisoner"s dilemma, it can be shown that doping is a dominant strategy which means that it is always much more profitable for both riders to dope. The game theoretic literature about doping has also proposed several new anti-doping policy recommendations, all focused on providing riders reduced incentives to use doping. Eber and Thépot (1999) advocate lower spreads between the prizes (which is in conflict with tournament theory), fewer races, improved testing and better prevention.</p>
	<p>However, as long as the wrong incentives are given to riders also these solutions will be of little help in the fight against doping. We therefore suggest a revolutionary anti-doping regulation in cycling where the riders themselves lose interest in the use of doping, or even have an interest not to dope even when other competitors do. This can be realized by the use of appropriate incentives. The suggested scheme below is to some extent in line with Breivik"s (1992) views, and elaborates on the "drug diary system" put forward in Bird and Wagner (1997), and on Andreff (2012). The device would work as follows:  At the start of the cycling season, all riders (in accordance with their doctors) must register compulsory the list of all doping substances and techniques they plan or, when necessary, want to use over the whole season. Such a doping diary is secret to the other riders. It could, for example, be deposited in the hands of each rider"s lawyer or with the UCI. Riders fully commit themselves to stick to the self-declared list of doping products.  If,during the season, a rider is tested positive for having taken products listed in his diary, no sanction applies.  However, if a rider is tested positive for having taken products not on this list, the sanction is extremely severe, for example a lifetime ban from professional cycling. A severe sanction is needed because not only did the rider use doping, he also cheated and blurred the transparency required for this scheme to be efficient. Because the rider does not want to comply with the rules of the game, he is excluded from professional cycling forever.  If a rider is performing extremely well, other riders who are suspicious (<quantifiedObject id="8960a0c2-9aa9-4f65-ab54-e2f7db9e79f7">anyone of</quantifiedObject> them, under the precondition that they are at least <measure type="interval" ptr="#8960a0c2-9aa9-4f65-ab54-e2f7db9e79f7">two</measure>) are allowed to ask the rider (or his lawyer or the UCI) to unveil his doping diary in order to check whether the rider complies with it.</p>
	<p> If it appears from (4) that the suspected rider does comply with his doping diary, the <measure type="interval" ptr="#becfce2b-05c4-47ad-b747-109af00cf0da">two</measure> or more <quantifiedObject id="becfce2b-05c4-47ad-b747-109af00cf0da">claiming riders</quantifiedObject> have to admit that the suspected rider either is definitely stronger than they are during this season or that his doping diary is more efficient or better programmed than their own.  As a result of this scheme, in particular at the beginning of such a regulation when there may be many claims against successful riders, other riders would have an incentive to copy the unveiled doping diary of the winners. This would trigger <measure type="value" ptr="#1e24f73b-bf61-4f09-99dc-281c9331d49a">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="1e24f73b-bf61-4f09-99dc-281c9331d49a">beneficial incentives</quantifiedObject>. First, step by step a doping norm (diary) will prevail in the whole peloton, a typical story of social norm formation. All riders will start to use the same most efficient or best conceived doping programme. Second, because of this social norm formation, riders will soon realize that the differential and artificial competitive advantage of hidden doping is limited and short-lived. Third, the omerta system will vanish because the best doping programme will be publicly known to and consequently openly used by all riders once the most performing doping diaries of suspected winners are unveiled.  Once riders are convinced that doping becomes useless as soon as doping substances and techniques are no longer differential between riders, it will not be very difficult to convince them that a same optimal doping recipe does not imply "the more the better".</p>
	<p>Moreover, such anti-doping regulation features an incentive scheme where each rider is not interested in more and more doping for himself, but instead is interested in benefiting from a competitor"s decision to over-dope beyond his declared programme. To illustrate this point, imagine a <measure type="value">four</measure>-rider racing circuit that operates under the above regulation. It will produce the following incentive scheme:</p>
	<p>(a) At the beginning of the season, rider A is more or better doped than riders B, C and D. He wins all the races (<measure type="value">100%</measure>).</p>
	<p>(b) In such situation, B, C and D will ask A to unveil his doping diary. Assume that A is complying with his diary. Other riders will then also adopt it and the <measure type="value" ptr="#6c109165-125d-4f7c-ac6d-74077da5673e">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="6c109165-125d-4f7c-ac6d-74077da5673e">riders</quantifiedObject> will share the wins (<measure type="value">25%</measure> each).</p>
	<p>(c) If rider A, in order to keep his initial advantage, decides after a while to cheat and over-dope beyond his self-declared diary, then he would again temporarily win <measure type="value">100%</measure> of the races, instead of <measure type="value">25%</measure>. As a result, B, C and D would again ask to unveil the doping diary of A. The anti-doping test would show that A did not comply with his doping diary and the rider would be banned for life from cycling. At the end of the day, the <measure type="value" ptr="#c2b22324-b420-4212-a8df-0e0683668aff">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c2b22324-b420-4212-a8df-0e0683668aff">remaining riders</quantifiedObject> would share the wins (<measure type="value">33%</measure> each).</p>
	<p>(d) Having learned from rider A"s poor experience, B, C and D probably would not cheat on their own diaries and would be satisfied with <measure type="value" ptr="#50417a62-386d-43bf-9a31-d5b4ad91b92a">33%</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="50417a62-386d-43bf-9a31-d5b4ad91b92a">all wins</quantifiedObject> (instead of the initial 0 and the subsequent <measure type="value">25%</measure>). If however, by chance, one of them does cheat according to his doping diary, the <measure type="value">two</measure> other will again intervene and will now share <measure type="value">50%</measure> each.</p>
	<p>Should one be optimistic about the above-suggested anti-doping regulation? For certain, it must not be considered to be a miracle solution. But the proposal at least focuses on a crucial point that could possibly be elaborated a bit further in forthcoming studies: the incentive scheme must convince riders that as soon as doping diaries are not differential between riders, doping is no longer a strategy that enables them to win more than their natural ability warrants. It may happen that there will be significant transition costs between the current anti-doping system and the one proposed here. In the first periods of the new regulation enforcement, some riders may feel or assume that the best performing doping programme is the most overloaded one. These riders might use substances dangerous to their health or life. If this assumption reveals to be true, they will soon be copied by other riders and lose their temporary comparative advantage. If on the contrary the assumption were to be wrong, or after a temporary increase in the number of sicknesses and deaths in the peloton (a sort of transition crisis between the <measure type="value" ptr="#16db7539-7c40-4971-b659-9521f031f96e">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="16db7539-7c40-4971-b659-9521f031f96e">anti-doping systems</quantifiedObject>, the hard price to pay for adopting the second one), all riders would be convinced that the best or optimal doping programme is in no way the most comprehensive or dangerous one in terms. It might be difficult though to convince stakeholders in cycling to enforce such a new regulation. Although riders would probably soon understand the mechanics of the embedded incentive scheme, they might be more concerned about the short-term effects of such a scheme on their health, i.e. when dangerous substances are put on the doping diary list (and subsequently used) by a large number of riders. But significant obstacles might also come from cycling governing bodies such as the UCI, Tour de France organisers ASO, and so on. They might especially fear the transparency about doping practices in the peloton that would result under such a regulation and its impact on the image (and thus the economic value) of cycling. Why not try to convince them as well that the good incentives that the proposed scheme creates are always preferable to the current bad incentives?</p>
	<p>The Tour de France is one of the most popular and attractive sport events in the world. It attracts millions of people along the roads and reaches a global TV audience. This results from its nice design and appropriate management, the fact it is a product that is supplied for free, an acceptable fitness with the prerequisites of tournament theory, and a modern model of finance linking its sporting success with TV rights revenues. However, the Tour success story is not decisively associated with an excellent competitive balance. A new metrics of the latter, adapted to the team sport dimension of cycling, exhibits that each Tour de France is basically imbalanced while its dynamic competitive balance over the years is much better. Already for a long time but especially since <measure type="interval">1998</measure> does the Tour de France has to deal with doping scandals and rider disqualifications, although so far this did not harm spectator and TV viewership interest for the Tour. However, the long term credibility of the Tour is still at stake. From this point of view, an innovative, more efficient and perhaps controversial antidoping regulation including incentives not to dope is developed here.</p>
