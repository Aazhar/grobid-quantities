	<p>We recently proposed a mathematical model to describe MTD dynamics in LGG patients before, during, and after chemotherapy. 16 The model, which distinguishes between disease-specific and treatment-specific parameters, relies on the hypothesis that LGG tumors are made up of both quiescent and proliferative cells, and that both cell types are sensitive to treatment. 18,19 Chemotherapy is assumed to act by damaging cells' DNA. The DNA damage leads proliferative cells to die, whereas quiescent cells with DNA damage can either repair their lesions and return to a proliferative state or die. Thus, we consider <measure type="value" ptr="#a122dfb0-4775-4709-b987-f378480cee06">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a122dfb0-4775-4709-b987-f378480cee06">compartments</quantifiedObject>: proliferative tissue, denoted P; nondamaged quiescent tissue, denoted Q; and damaged quiescent tissue, denoted Q p .

	<p>The model was developed in a population context, 20 and the values of individual-level parameters were assumed to be log-normally distributed; i.e., for a parameter w i corresponding to an individual patient i, w i =w.expg i where w is the "typical" (population) value of the parameter, and g i represents the contribution of the individual i. The values of g are normally distributed with <quantifiedObject id="88710625-3804-4881-b79a-3ec3c9971dc3">mean</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#88710625-3804-4881-b79a-3ec3c9971dc3">0</measure>. Population and individual parameter values were estimated with the SAEM (Stochastic Approximation of the Expectation Maximization) algorithm implemented in Monolix 4.2 (Lixoft) using the full MTD time-course in the <measure type="value" ptr="#f54fb488-b159-4edf-b642-2d25e1ead1eb">77</measure> <quantifiedObject id="f54fb488-b159-4edf-b642-2d25e1ead1eb">patients</quantifiedObject>. We assumed a constant error model, with parameter value a. Model selection was carried out according to the usual criteria; in particular, models that achieved lower values of the objective function (22 3 log likelihood) were considered to provide a better fit to the data.</p>
	<p>The data from the <measure type="value" ptr="#1cfaab0d-5c64-4453-9b41-bca52510a697">42</measure> <quantifiedObject id="1cfaab0d-5c64-4453-9b41-bca52510a697">patients with</quantifiedObject> complete molecular status (codeletion 1p/19q, p53, and IDH mutations) was used as a training dataset to obtain statistics on this genetic information. We computed the percentage of patients with a given genetic profile and derived the probability to exhibit it. So for patients with <measure type="list">one or two</measure> missing covariates, we could compute the probability to exhibit the lacking mutation status(es), knowing the other(s) one(s). We therefore attributed genetic characteristics for patients with missing covariates. In our training dataset, in line with previous literature, 12 1p/ 19q codeletion and the p53 mutation were mutually exclusive. We incorporated the molecular information into the model and identified the effect of each status on the tumor size kinetic parameters. For a given fixed-effect parameter f, the model used for covariate analysis was of the following form:</p>
	<p>We used a stepwise forward/backward modeling strategy based on progressive inclusion and then exclusion of covariates, where the decision to include or exclude a covariate was dependent on the covariate's effect on the objective function through a log-likelihood ratio test. 21 Empirical Bayes estimates to predict LGG response to temozolomide Following a Bayesian approach in which population<quantifiedObject id="c5bb6619-922c-49b8-906a-e678f019cb2f"> paramete</quantifiedObject>r estimates constituted prior information, we analyzed each patient's data individually, considering only the MTD observations prior to treatment and the first MTD observations obtained after treatment onset, i.e., the observations obtained in the first <measure type="value" ptr="#c5bb6619-922c-49b8-906a-e678f019cb2f">3 months</measure> of treatment. If, for a given patient, no observations were available prior to treatment, we used only the MTD observations obtained within the first <measure type="value" ptr="#04f88173-1c5a-4c44-b76f-630b5b567a21">3 months</measure> after treatment onset. Patients for whom no information was available for the first <measure type="value" ptr="#8482a982-4d10-4235-8629-bdafcad721a1">3 months</measure> of treatment were excluded from the analysis. Overall, data from <measure type="value" ptr="#33328c0d-404f-44d0-8599-f4ac706a2aed">45</measure> <quantifiedObject id="33328c0d-404f-44d0-8599-f4ac706a2aed">patients</quantifiedObject> were analyzed.

When possible, MTD observations before treatment onset were used to estimate empirical Bayes estimates (EBEs) of the disease-specific parameters of the model. The MTD observations after treatment start were then used to estimate the treatment-specific parameters of the model. EBEs were calculated using MatLab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) after the population parameters were estimated with Monolix.</p>
	<p>To evaluate the capacity of the model to predict individual tumor response to TMZ treatment, <measure type="value" ptr="#f2f1c1a1-11e1-4264-bb65-0bbd74c07d4c">two</measure> clinically <quantifiedObject id="f2f1c1a1-11e1-4264-bb65-0bbd74c07d4c">relevant metrics</quantifiedObject> were calculated: the duration of response, i.e., the length of time during which MTD decreases, and the minimal tumor size reached as a result of TMZ effect.</p>
	<p>In the analysis described above, the model's predictive capacity was assessed on patients whose full time-course data were used to estimate the population parameters; these population parameters constituted prior information for the calculation of EBEs. To explore whether this caused a bias, we subsequently performed predictive analysis on the <measure type="value">43</measure> "external" patients whose data had been excluded from the initial model-building process, owing to a lack of genetic information. In this case, we used early MTD observations as in the original predictive analysis, but without covariates.</p>
	<p>We then used population parameters to simulate <measure type="value" ptr="#131342a5-8f95-4141-ab64-1bdb258b2db6">200</measure> <quantifiedObject id="131342a5-8f95-4141-ab64-1bdb258b2db6">new virtual patients</quantifiedObject>, and we made predictions for these patients using the model without covariates in a first step, and we incorporated genetic statuses into the predictions in a second step.</p>
	<p>Tumor size time-course in patients treated with temozolomide Figure 1 depicts the time-course of tumor size (mean tumor diameter) in the <measure type="value">77</measure> LGG patients included in the analysis.

Tumor size increased linearly before treatment. 22 After TMZ onset, an initial MTD decrease followed by a MTD reincrease was observed (<quantifiedObject id="4df51daa-ee07-442d-909b-998183800efd">n</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#4df51daa-ee07-442d-909b-998183800efd">5 58, 75%</measure>).

We separated the patients to present tumor profiles in a clear manner, but it did not impact data analysis.</p>
	<p>Inclusion of a resistance term for the proliferative tissue resulted in a significantly better model fit (drop of <measure type="value" ptr="#42f05a4f-9dae-46ec-afd9-59823f716604">200</measure> <quantifiedObject id="42f05a4f-9dae-46ec-afd9-59823f716604">points in</quantifiedObject> the objective function) compared with exclusion of the resistance term. The model with the inclusion of a resistance term for the quiescent tissue performed worse. However, because quiescent cells have the capacity to repair their DNA lesions, they also contribute to the emergence of resistance by repopulating the proliferative compartment. Thus, the final selected model incorporated a resistance term for the proliferative tissue only:</p>
	<p>The term res denotes the resistance parameter. Given the time scale of data collection compared to the time scale of TMZ delivery scheduling, we represented a single TMZ cycle (actually composed of <measure type="value" ptr="#dea04ad7-62d3-45e1-ae67-0683476cf92d">five</measure> <quantifiedObject id="dea04ad7-62d3-45e1-ae67-0683476cf92d">daily administrations</quantifiedObject>) as a single bolus administration with corresponding concentration, C, assumed to undergo exponential decay at a constant rate KDE (a so-called K-PD approach 23 ). The population value of KDE parameter was fixed to <measure type="value">8.3 month</measure> <measure type="value">21</measure> corresponding to a <measure type="value" ptr="#01b072c3-eb4a-4d29-a51c-6aa53b8b3464">half</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="01b072c3-eb4a-4d29-a51c-6aa53b8b3464">life of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#99da2ff1-0740-4c64-aff3-b1ffc726ae9d">2.5 days</measure>, allowing for a residual active concentration of TMZ after <measure type="value" ptr="#24d8726b-47bf-42d4-8848-f88cc9815dd9">5 days</measure> of treatment. The parameter c is the constant rate for proliferative tissue death (also referred to as the TMZ efficacy parameter). A schematic view of the model is presented in Figure 2. The full mathematical equations of the model are:</p>
	<p>Overall, the model includes <measure type="value" ptr="#d759116c-997c-41eb-ae89-d2088df01262">seven</measure> <quantifiedObject id="d759116c-997c-41eb-ae89-d2088df01262">parameters and</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#e3aedc82-e255-4a5a-95f5-05a6196d087a">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e3aedc82-e255-4a5a-95f5-05a6196d087a">initial conditions</quantifiedObject>. <measure type="value" ptr="#f5694d07-536d-4ff7-9540-d8b15c161e2e">Two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="f5694d07-536d-4ff7-9540-d8b15c161e2e">parameters</quantifiedObject> are disease-specific and related to tumor growth: the proliferation rate (k P ) and the transfer constant rate (k PQ ) from proliferation to quiescence.

In particular, the constant rate of death of quiescent cells is denoted d Qp and k Qp P is the constant rate of transition from quiescence to proliferation following repair of TMZ-induced DNA damage. For identifiability reasons, we assumed that the initial drug effect is the same on P and Q. This is consistent with the biology, as TMZ acts on cells regardless of their stage in the division process.</p>

This is in agreement with the known redundancy of the genetic information 24 and indicates that, in our model, p53 and 1p/19q information intrinsically integrate IDH information. The parameter estimates of the final model (including covariates) are presented in Table 2.</p>
	<p>Among p53-mutated patients, the value of the TMZ efficacy parameter is <measure type="value">45%</measure> lower than among p53-nonmutated patients, suggesting that TMZ therapy is almost <measure type="value" ptr="#e530208e-5047-41b8-8782-5457b3904ee0">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e530208e-5047-41b8-8782-5457b3904ee0">times</quantifiedObject> less effective in the former population.

For a small subset of patients (n 5 4), the unique MTD point during the first <measure type="value" ptr="#dc0360a7-1d8b-436d-8299-00a696d0e88b">3 months</measure> of treatment was greater than the MTD at treatment onset, while successive MTD points showed a significant response. Integrating this point in our modeling framework resulted in predicting very early progression. However, removing these <measure type="value" ptr="#84de5fbb-8c33-4397-b2fe-b241553b4f85">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="84de5fbb-8c33-4397-b2fe-b241553b4f85">patients</quantifiedObject> resulted in correcting the early part of the Kaplan-Meier curve. Figure 4 also shows predicted vs. observed minimal tumor size (right-hand side). We evaluated prediction bias (mean prediction error) and precision (root mean squared prediction error). 27 Prediction bias was <measure type="value">1.89 mm</measure> (<measure type="value">95%</measure> CI (<measure type="interval">-0.22, 3.99</measure>)) and precision was <measure type="value">7.18 mm</measure> (<measure type="value">95%</measure> CI (<measure type="interval">4.52, 9.10</measure>)). For <measure type="value" ptr="#0e33f3d7-236b-490b-a8d5-b46810e20a8a">90%</measure> of the patients (n 5 40), the observed minimal tumor size was predicted correctly, with less than <measure type="interval" ptr="#b10aa154-d4d7-4e5c-a6bc-485a1a84a6f3">25%</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b10aa154-d4d7-4e5c-a6bc-485a1a84a6f3">relative error</quantifiedObject> (relative to tumor size at treatment onset); this corresponds, approximately, to an error of about <measure type="value" ptr="#06826dcf-0b5a-468c-a3ef-1575a36649b8">1 cm</measure> in MTD.

It shows that the model is also able to predict tumor time-course, especially for these patients. For the <measure type="value" ptr="#bf52cb26-5cd7-48f8-b57f-89b60064e709">10%</measure> of patients (n 5 5) for whom predictions of minimal tumor size were incorrect, we observed that, for <measure type="value" ptr="#d0c2d637-6084-441a-a40e-4cefb7fd4490">four</measure> of them, tumor size reduction was unexpectedly characterized by <measure type="value" ptr="#0d1cdfe2-a26a-404b-ad1a-0701b537f6ca">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="0d1cdfe2-a26a-404b-ad1a-0701b537f6ca">phases</quantifiedObject>: an initial moderate decrease in tumor size within the first <measure type="value" ptr="#0267d5e4-1182-4d14-916e-a7e440cc2efe">5 months</measure> of treatment, followed by a more <quantifiedObject id="bdd4413b-4c46-41b7-9c23-bac6edf5b5ca">pronounced decrease after</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#bdd4413b-4c46-41b7-9c23-bac6edf5b5ca">5 months</measure>.

Inclusion of a second MTD observation (obtained after <measure type="value" ptr="#832f435d-dd0e-422b-96f2-601c4495235b">5 months</measure> of treatment) yielded correct minimal tumor size predictions for these patients.

The model may not be able to capture such extreme behavior. We then performed predictive analysis on the <measure type="value">43</measure> "external" patients. The model successfully predicted the minimal tumor size for <measure type="value" ptr="#4958b2cf-4e9e-44e8-956c-72ad85f10a87">75%</measure> of these patients (bias <measure type="value">24.41 mm</measure> (<measure type="interval">-7.14, 21.67</measure>)). To evaluate whether the reduction in predictive capability was due to the lack of genetic information or to the fact that these patients' data were not incorporated as prior information in model-building, we made predictions for <measure type="value" ptr="#c677f958-14ea-440c-aa28-a87b27ca6151">200</measure> <quantifiedObject id="c677f958-14ea-440c-aa28-a87b27ca6151">virtual patients</quantifiedObject>. Without covariates, the minimal tumor size was successfully predicted for <measure type="value" ptr="#78364c62-e477-495c-93eb-8c6049cf9d57">76%</measure> of the virtual patients. When we incorporated genetic statuses, predictive capacity rose to <measure type="value">87%</measure> (bias <measure type="value">0.31 mm</measure> (<measure type="interval">-0.86, 1.49</measure>)). These observations lead us to believe that the reduction in the model's predictive capacity for the <measure type="value" ptr="#587e48a0-a6af-487a-b13a-9420b556ff14">43</measure> <quantifiedObject id="587e48a0-a6af-487a-b13a-9420b556ff14">external patients</quantifiedObject> was mainly due to the absence of genetic information.</p>
	<p>Molecular information (p53 and 1p/19q status) and tumor observations obtained during the first <measure type="value" ptr="#f7c851e5-2bbe-45bd-999e-35af69dcb712">3 months</measure> after <quantifiedObject id="f7c851e5-2bbe-45bd-999e-35af69dcb712">TMZ treatment onset</quantifiedObject> were sufficient to correctly predict the amplitude of response and <quantifiedObject id="1b903ce8-aa06-4298-80d8-7276a2ba219b">its duration for</quantifiedObject> almost <measure type="value" ptr="#1b903ce8-aa06-4298-80d8-7276a2ba219b">2 years</measure>, especially in those patients in whom precise assessment of early tumor response was available. An adaptive approach, consisting of updating the model predictions at each new MTD observation, could be implemented to prolong the validity period of the prediction and to enhance the percentage of patients for whom the minimal tumor size is successfully predicted. These results, however, need to be confirmed in a larger set of external patients. It would also be interesting to evaluate the relationship between the predictive performance of the model and the timing of MTD observations used for predictive purposes. In this study, we focused on MTD observations obtained during the first <measure type="value" ptr="#a826fa76-5cfc-4c6a-9305-4e934606cec4">3 months</measure> of treatment because we wanted to obtain a reference or rational value for the predictive potential of the model. In the area of brain tumor, numerous studies have used partial differential equation models integrating both time dynamics and spatial aspects of these highly diffusive malignancies (see refs. 31,32 for examples). It would also be important to apply the same prediction framework with these types of models, which capture more precisely glioma evolution.</p>
	<p>Emergence of acquired resistance, defined as progression after initial benefits, is a critical issue in clinical oncology and model-based approaches should be used to better understand, characterize, and predict this phenomenon. Mechanisms of acquired resistance can be pharmacological resulting from decreased drug uptake into the cell, intracellular drug inactivation, or repair of drug-induced damages. This is the case of the LGG response to TMZ, for which it has been shown that more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#e3e3ecc1-8fa6-44af-969f-8085b1b356ce">90</measure><quantifiedObject id="e3e3ecc1-8fa6-44af-969f-8085b1b356ce">% of</quantifiedObject> recurrent gliomas show no response to a second treatment with TMZ. 33 One of the key elements in TMZ resistance is <quantifiedObject id="89cbaf63-d616-4f6b-9e2c-ecb3e576ed04">MGMT</quantifiedObject>, an enzymatic protein with the faculty to repair the principal O 6 -meG-alkylation site to TMZ, <measure type="value" ptr="#89cbaf63-d616-4f6b-9e2c-ecb3e576ed04">34</measure> thus resulting in decreased efficacy of drugs during treatment. MGMT could not be tested as a covariate in our model since for most patients only formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was available for DNA tests, whereas MGMT methylation testing ideally needs frozen tissue. Of note, resistance to TMZ is also responsible for significant therapeutic failures in melanoma. 35 Following this biological knowledge, we modeled acquisition of resistance by decreasing drug efficacy on LGG proliferative tissue with time following therapy onset. Since all patients received the same TMZ doses with the same scheduling, we believe that modeling resistance as a function of actual drug exposure would not have led to significantly different results. For identifiability reasons, we could not model all transitions between the <measure type="value" ptr="#2d3118b6-a7af-468d-9858-80842d057dfa">three</measure> <quantifiedObject id="2d3118b6-a7af-468d-9858-80842d057dfa">compartments</quantifiedObject>, especially the possibility for quiescent cells to directly return into proliferation, as it could occur without treatment. However, during treatment quiescent cells do have the capacity to repair their DNA and become proliferative. Therefore, this model is a relevant tool to characterize tumor response to TMZ but does not aim to faithfully mimic natural tumor growth. Our model is flexible enough to reproduce the variability of patients' response to standard TMZ protocol and has the capacity to mimic both tumor regrowth during treatment as a result of acquired resistance to TMZ and prolonged response to treatment. Finally, our model could constitute a rational tool to optimize the duration of temozolomide therapy in low-grade glioma patients. Up to now, there are no clear rules or guidelines regarding the optimal number of cycles or treatment duration in patients treated with TMZ. 15 Many neurooncologists prolong the duration of the treatment beyond <measure type="interval" ptr="#92cf38d8-9197-4d06-8f41-d94b0af3c60d">12</measure> <quantifiedObject id="92cf38d8-9197-4d06-8f41-d94b0af3c60d">cycles</quantifiedObject> if an ongoing decrease in tumor size is observed at this time. However, there are downsides to prolonging TMZ treatment, including side effects and costs. An even greater concern is that TMZ therapy might drive the evolutionary path to high-grade glioma. 36 Consequently, determining the optimal duration of TMZ therapy and maximizing the duration of the response is a critical challenge in the management of</p>
	<p>LGG. Using our model as a simulation tool to determine the optimal number of TMZ cycles each patient should have received, we found that for <measure type="value" ptr="#29bc3c43-34f2-4770-9a77-37c2638cabc0">47%</measure> (n 5 21), the model would have recommended, by month 3 after treatment onset, administration of additional TMZ cycles beyond what these patients actually received; i.e., in these patients delivery of additional TMZ could have resulted in tumor shrinkage exceeding what was ultimately achieved. In contrast, the model predicted that <measure type="value" ptr="#1247aab2-006b-43af-80fe-c97d6c263a63">33%</measure> of the patients (n 5 15) could have benefited if their treatment had been stopped earlier than it actually was.</p></text>
