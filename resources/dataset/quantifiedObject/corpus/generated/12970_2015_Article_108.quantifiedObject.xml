	<p>Background: Endurance athletes are advised to optimize nutrition prior to races. Little is known about actual athletes' beliefs, knowledge and nutritional behaviour. We monitored nutritional behaviour of amateur ski-mountaineering athletes during <measure type="value">4 days</measure> prior to a major competition to compare it with official recommendations and with the athletes' beliefs.</p>
	<p>A particular type endurance sport is ski-mountaineering racing, consisting of climbing uphill on alpine skis with the heals unlocked in special pivoting bindings and adhesive skins applied to the gliding surface, alternated by skiing downhill with the skins removed and the bindings in the locked position. What makes this sport particular is that it combines very strenuous activity in different locomotion modes with exposure to altitude hypoxia and temperature extremes. Especially uphill the exercise intensity is high with a large fraction of time spend around the respiratory compensation threshold [20][21][22]. The most popular and famous ski-mountaineering races are generally team races that can last from <measure type="interval">4</measure> to more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#6521a74b-ff49-4db9-bb1e-5138a811b09a">12</measure> <quantifiedObject id="6521a74b-ff49-4db9-bb1e-5138a811b09a">h.</quantifiedObject> We previously quantified energy expenditure during a famous Swiss ski-mountaineering race ('Patrouille des Glaciers') and found that it was very high: more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#a6897df1-4030-46c7-8773-240ae00c9708">20</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a6897df1-4030-46c7-8773-240ae00c9708">MJ</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value">4,800 kcal</measure>) for the shorter race route (distance: <measure type="value">26 km</measure>; altitude differences: +<measure type="list">1881 m and −2341</measure> m; maximal altitude: <measure type="value" ptr="#b2e33f24-0828-4f94-bbe6-25554f6040aa">3160 m</measure>) and more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#5c5d7cb2-a3e0-49a2-b8a2-d8fa3f0cdd59">35</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5c5d7cb2-a3e0-49a2-b8a2-d8fa3f0cdd59">MJ</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#c88d8b2b-74a0-4cf2-96a5-7adbe375114a">8,400 kcal</measure>) for the longer one (distance: <measure type="value">53 km</measure>; altitude differences: +<measure type="list">3994 m and−4090</measure> m; maximal altitude: <measure type="value">3650 m</measure>) [22].</p>
	<p>The goal of the present study was to get a global perspective on pre-race nutritional habits among amateur ski-mountaineers during the <measure type="value">4 days</measure> preceding this major <measure type="value">multi-hour</measure> ski-mountaineering race. <measure type="value" ptr="#e916dca9-a411-4cd5-8559-7b71cbe58a4e">Four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e916dca9-a411-4cd5-8559-7b71cbe58a4e">different aspects</quantifiedObject> were investigated: 1) pre-competition nutritional practice; 2) comparison between practice and recommendations; 3) comparison of food behaviour between participants in longer and shorter races; and 4) knowledge and beliefs about pre-race nutrition.</p>

The nutritional part of the study was optional for participants. The Valais cantonal research ethics committee approved the protocol of the study (CCVEM 033/11) and each participant gave informed written consent prior to participation.</p>
	<p>Between <measure type="interval">2 and 3 months</measure> prior to the race, the subjects came to the laboratory, where anthropometric features, body composition and maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max ) were determined. Body fat percentage was measured by air displacement plethysmography (BodPod, Cosmed, Italy). The subjects performed a maximal running test on a motorized treadmill (HP Cosmos Pulsar, Germany) to determine VO 2max . After warm-up (<measure type="value">3 min</measure> at <measure type="value" ptr="#78d19955-07f2-4531-8462-bcfbcb1bfed0">5.4 km · h −1</measure> ), speed was set at <measure type="value">7.2 km · h −1</measure> and increased by <measure type="value">1.8 km · h −1</measure> every <measure type="value" ptr="#8f4d33b2-5f25-4cdf-ab22-6ff17a3e2482">3 min</measure> without breaks between stages up to voluntary exhaustion under strong verbal encouragement. The inclination of the treadmill was <measure type="value">0 %</measure>. Gas exchange and breathing variables were measured breathby-breath throughout with a metabolic measurement system (Metalyser, Cortex, Germany). The data obtained during the last <measure type="value" ptr="#f1f6a997-2502-4e82-9dde-6f1f7c56bdb0">30 s</measure> of each step were considered for the analysis.

	<p>We asked the subjects to complete food diaries during the <measure type="value">4 days</measure> preceding the race. They had to write down everything they ate or drank with as much detail as possible about the quality and quantity of food items consumed. The subjects received detailed instructions and examples to help them to appropriately complete their diaries.

	<p>Using the diaries, individual semi-structured interviews were held <measure type="value">two years</measure> later with a pool of <measure type="value" ptr="#6cb74949-26d2-458e-9c1e-64e2747e1ab4">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="6cb74949-26d2-458e-9c1e-64e2747e1ab4">subjects of</quantifiedObject> those with a complete diary.

Based on the initial answers to these questions the interviewers asked the participants further questions, to develop and explore details about points that seemed to be especially interesting or needed clarification. <measure type="value" ptr="#73819cb8-b288-44a5-948d-69bdcfefc2d7">Five</measure> <quantifiedObject id="73819cb8-b288-44a5-948d-69bdcfefc2d7">subjects for</quantifiedObject> each race route were interviewed.

	<p>An ANOVA was used to test whether the <measure type="value">four analysed days</measure> were similar and to see if pooled mean values could be used for further analysis. For each nutrient the mean and standard deviation values were calculated for the whole population and for the participants in the race Z and the race A separately. T-tests were performed to verify if there were differences between the participants in the shorter and the longer race. Linear regressions were performed to verify associations between sex, body composition or VO 2 max and aspects of nutritional behaviour. Data were analysed with the software Stata (StataCorp, USA).

	<p>There was no significant difference concerning the main analysed variables (energy, CHO and drinking intake) between the <measure type="value">four analysed days</measure>, so the data were pooled and <quantifiedObject id="96cf8f5e-8a05-4d45-8884-68db385567d9">the mean values of</quantifiedObject> the <measure type="value" ptr="#96cf8f5e-8a05-4d45-8884-68db385567d9">4 days</measure> were used for further analysis. The mean energy consumption was <measure type="interval">2416 ± 696 kcal · day −1</measure> . <measure type="interval">54 ± 8 %</measure> of the daily energy intake was from CHO, <measure type="interval">28 ± 6 %</measure> from fat and <measure type="interval">18 ± 5 %</measure> from protein ( Table 1, Fig. 1). CHO intake was <measure type="interval">46 ± 13 %</measure> below <quantifiedObject id="a69ecbd1-b282-4803-8b09-74fd516dea1b">the recommended intake levels</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="interval" ptr="#a69ecbd1-b282-4803-8b09-74fd516dea1b">10-12 g · body weight (BW) · day −1</measure> ) ( Fig. 1). Consequently energy consumption was low too (<measure type="interval">83 ± 17 %</measure> of recommended intake (Harris and Benedict · 1.8 (low exercise intensity, corresponding to a pre-race tapering period) [2]), but the deficit was limited because fat and protein intake partly compensated the lack of CHO intake ( Fig. 2). The energy intake through fat was <measure type="interval">29 ± 6 %</measure> ( Fig. 3) of the total daily energy intake (recommendations: between <measure type="interval">15 and 30 %</measure>) while protein intake was <measure type="interval">100 ± 28 %</measure> of the minimal recommended intake for athletes in <quantifiedObject id="071422e2-6bdd-4757-b721-e914fabf354a">daily life</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#071422e2-6bdd-4757-b721-e914fabf354a">1.3 g · kg −1 BW · day −1</measure> ). The mean liquid intake was <measure type="interval">2.7 ± 1.0 l · day −1</measure> (slightly above recommendations, <measure type="value">1 ml · kcal −1 · day −1</measure> in <quantifiedObject id="5dad1252-aed1-44f2-b1f0-c41b7f83def1">daily life</quantifiedObject>, <measure type="value" ptr="#5dad1252-aed1-44f2-b1f0-c41b7f83def1">2.4 l · day −1</measure> ), partly compliant with the guidelines to already increase the liquid intake before the beginning of a race, without giving a specific amount [23].</p>

	<p>There were few differences between the nutritional behaviour of men and women: men consumed more energy from fat (p = <measure type="value">0.049</measure>) and tended to consume less energy from <quantifiedObject id="50a01a2f-98c6-49a2-8f22-134af0e59c2a">CHO</quantifiedObject> (p = <measure type="value" ptr="#50a01a2f-98c6-49a2-8f22-134af0e59c2a">0.061</measure>) than women.

	<p>Our intention was to explore <measure type="value">4-day</measure> pre-race nutritional habits and beliefs among amateur athletes participating to a major <measure type="value" ptr="#3cb2a654-f213-4ef6-bd41-5d008a176767">multi-hour</measure> ski-<quantifiedObject id="3cb2a654-f213-4ef6-bd41-5d008a176767">mountaineering race</quantifiedObject>. The main findings were that 1) the energy and CHO intake was below recommended amounts, while protein and fat intake were close to the recommended intake; 2) the main difference between the participants in the shorter and longer races were liquid, supplement and sports food intakes; and 3) that knowledge and beliefs about pre-race nutrition among these amateur athletes participating to extreme endurance events are insufficient or incorrect.</p>
	<p>It is generally believed that high CHO intake to optimize glycogen storage is the most specific and important recommendation for endurance activity to ensure an appropriate energy supply all along a <measure type="value">multi hour</measure> endurance race [5]. The CHO stores (muscle and liver glycogen) are limited and need to be regularly refuelled. CHO ingestion is thus thought to be very important, whether it is to increase glycogen storage before a workout, during a race to avoid hypoglycaemia and to protect muscle and liver glycogen stores, or after a race to ensure recovery and optimal glycogen resynthesis [6,7]. Low muscle glycogen stores during exercise, when accompanied by dropping blood glucose levels can cause performance decreases, subjective feelings of low levels of energy, sensation of heavy legs, excess fatigue, loss of concentration, irritability, dizziness and fainting [7,24]. So it is important to ensure glycogen store fuelling and refuelling and it is better to start a race with full stores [6,7], especially since the capacity to eat and process food during a race is limited [25]. Current recommendations for CHO storage before an endurance race are <measure type="interval">10 to 12 g · kg BW −1 · day −1</measure> , starting <measure type="interval">36 to 48 h</measure> prior to the race [2,9,10].</p>
	<p>The average CHO consumption in our population was less than <measure type="interval">half</measure> (<measure type="interval">46 ± 13 %</measure>) of <quantifiedObject id="50d8cde9-569c-4336-bc3d-676af9b767c9">these recommended levels</quantifiedObject> and in fact not even a single participant to our study reached them. Given the belief of the interviewed athletes, that high CHO intake is important prior to such endurance events, this finding is surprising and possibly suggests lack of understanding of the concept of prerace CHO loading. On the other hand, it may also reflect difficulties in reaching the recommended CHO amounts just by varying the quantities and proportions of the usual dietary components, without using additional specific CHO-rich sports food to allow the athletes reaching CHO and total energy-intake values closer to the guidelines. Our observations lead us to ask the question whether today's guidelines are adequate for practical use. The observed average CHO consumption in our sample was so far from the recommendations that it suggests that it might have been too difficult for our participants to reach the recommendations by consuming twice as much CHO as they did, even if it were only during the last <measure type="interval">24 to 36 h</measure> and not during the full <measure type="value">4 days</measure> we looked at.</p>
	<p>For the other macronutrients: fat and proteins, there are no specific pre-race recommen<quantifiedObject id="30234aeb-75c8-489f-8ab1-36f16705958f">dations</quantifiedObject> for endurance activities, but there are guidelines for athletes in daily life. Endurance athletes are advised to consume between <measure type="interval" ptr="#30234aeb-75c8-489f-8ab1-36f16705958f">1.2 and 1.8 g · kg BW -1 · day −1</measure> of protein [8,9] and daily fat intake should amount to <measure type="interval" ptr="#e17de86c-26fe-4248-9432-6743e5d36901">20 to 35 %</measure> of total energy intake [2,[8][9][10]. For these nutrients the intakes of the subjects complied with the guidelines.</p>
	<p>Fluid and electrolyte intake are thought to be important for performance because dehydration, when exceeding <measure type="interval" ptr="#7f603b23-49b1-4a35-bbe2-212ad271442e">2-3 %</measure> of <quantifiedObject id="7f603b23-49b1-4a35-bbe2-212ad271442e">body mass</quantifiedObject>, may cause performance impairment [2], even though there is on-going debate on this topic [26]. So it is important to start races in euhydration and to drink enough and frequently during races [8]. Since we only have information about pre-race behaviour and have no data on habitual fluid intake in our subjects we do not know if, according to the recommendations, they increased their fluid intake prior to the race. Intake was on average <measure type="value">2.7 l · day −1</measure> , which is slightly above the recommendations for habitual daily intake (<measure type="value">2.4 l · day −1</measure> ) [23]. Also in this case the beliefs of the interviewed athletes contrast with their behaviour since <measure type="value">9 out of 10</measure> mentioned the importance of increasing liquid intake in the last days prior to a major race but only drank an average <measure type="value">2.2 l · day −1</measure> .</p>
	<p>Although several studies showed that vitamin and/or mineral supplementation does not improve performance during anaerobic [27], strength [28], endurance [28,29] or ultra-endurance [30] exercise, if the daily diet is adequate [31], supplement intake remains widespread among athletes [30,32,33]. In our population, <measure type="value">a third</measure> of the participants took such supplements. The recommendation is to abstain from vitamin or mineral supplementation if the athlete eats enough and a wide variety of food and in the absence of a known deficit [3]. Additionally, it is important to be careful and to estimate the safety, the efficacy, the potency and the legality of a supplement before taking it [2,[8][9][10]. Besides supplements, special sports food consumption was also widespread. Endurance athletes mostly consume special CHO drinks, gels or bars, which can help reaching the recommendations for energy and CHO intake [18,34]. But in spite of <measure type="value" ptr="#70b9df0f-5c45-47b9-9340-ba207d59b18a">58 %</measure> of the <measure type="value" ptr="#e89f07ae-323e-4410-93a6-78014c819e29">40</measure> <quantifiedObject id="e89f07ae-323e-4410-93a6-78014c819e29">participants</quantifiedObject> using CHO-rich sports food or drinks, their CHO intake remained far below the recommendations.</p>
	<p>Digestive comfort is another key variable during endurance events such as <measure type="value" ptr="#d9c77ea8-6329-44a6-87a3-1292d7897e64">multi-hour</measure> ski-<quantifiedObject id="d9c77ea8-6329-44a6-87a3-1292d7897e64">mountaineering races</quantifiedObject> [35,36]. Digestive discomfort and gastrointestinal distress like cramps, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and diarrhoea are frequently reported during ultra-endurance activities, particularly during ultra-marathon running [35][36][37]. To avoid gastrointestinal distress during racing, athletes are advised to avoid dehydration, high-fibre food intake, and hypertonic beverages, and to practice their planned race nutrition strategies before the actual race [36][37][38]. It is difficult to say from the food diaries which food items were specifically avoided during these <measure type="value">4 days</measure>, because we do not know the habitual diet of the participants, but from the interviews it seemed that mostly red meat and other fatty food items were avoided.</p>
	<p>In general, the athletes seemed to be well aware of the importance of pre-race nutrition for performance. The participants in the longer race Z placed a more particular emphasis on this topic than the participants to the shorter race A. They also trained more, used lighter racing gear (<measure type="interval">12.4 ± 2.5 kg</measure> vs. <measure type="interval">15.4 ± 3.2 kg</measure>) and their supplement and sports food intake was higher. The participants in the longer Z race were likely more ambitious and experienced athletes, who tried noticeably harder to optimize everything for the race. Our finding of lower lipid consumption by participants with a higher VO 2 max and/or lower body fat percentage, as well as the higher energy, CHO and liquid consumption of participants with lower body fat percentage also seem in accordance with this contention.</p>
	<p>In spite of the declared importance of adequate nutrition in preparation of an endurance event, the knowledge on this topic was approximate. <measure type="value">Half</measure> of the interviewed participants confused supplementation with sports food; all the participants believed that it is good for them to eat a lot of pasta during the <measure type="value">4 days</measure> preceding the race, but rarely spoke about CHO and other CHO sources. Moreover, it seemed to be difficult for them to explain why they choose some food items and avoided others. The overall impression was that it rather reflected beliefs than knowledge [15].</p>
	<p>Our results should be interpreted taking into account some study limitations. Despite participation of <measure type="value" ptr="#91c6c67d-8f4b-4beb-83b6-f34c0d6b4a6a">70</measure> <quantifiedObject id="91c6c67d-8f4b-4beb-83b6-f34c0d6b4a6a">subjects</quantifiedObject> to the study we obtained only <measure type="value" ptr="#924f72b2-4cf9-4263-a705-5ef2e46a23e4">40</measure> complete food <quantifiedObject id="924f72b2-4cf9-4263-a705-5ef2e46a23e4">intake diaries</quantifiedObject> that could be analysed of which <measure type="value">25 %</measure> was discussed in detail during the face-to-face semi-structured interviews. The number of observations is therefore limited and not necessarily representative for all amateur athletes participating to the 'Patrouille des Glaciers' and similar extreme endurance events. Also, the interviews were performed <measure type="value">two years</measure> after the race and obviously some detail may have been lost. However, it is unlikely that <quantifiedObject id="d84e0cee-c068-4180-a32e-ae400982dc6d">the major individual beliefs changed</quantifiedObject> over these <measure type="value" ptr="#d84e0cee-c068-4180-a32e-ae400982dc6d">two years</measure> [39]. The overall strategy, grounded in the personal beliefs was probably close to that of race day. Finally, food diaries are known to be unreliable with frequent under and ill reporting of intake [40], so that our results should be interpreted as semi-quantitative.</p>
	<p>This study about pre-competition nutritional habits and beliefs of amateur athletes before a long duration skimountaineering race showed that: although most of the athletes seemed aware of the importance of nutrition for endurance sports and specifically before a major race, their knowledge was approximate and a clear sound nutritional strategy was missing. Their average CHO intake represented less than <measure type="interval">half</measure> of the recommended intake, while energy intake was on average <measure type="value">17 %</measure> too low. There was no significant difference in the energy and macronutrient intake of the participants in the longer and the shorter race, but participants in the longer race drank significantly more, used more mineral and vitamin supplements and more sports food and drinks.</p></text>
