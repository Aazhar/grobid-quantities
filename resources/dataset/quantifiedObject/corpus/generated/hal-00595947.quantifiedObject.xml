	<p>In this paper a different compromise solution is chosen. More precisely, it is assumed that the sailcraft attitude motion is purely passive with the exception of a finite number of reorientation maneuvers whose aim is to rotate the sail such as to set the thrust to <measure type="value">zero</measure> and generate suitable coasting arcs along the trajectory, see Figure 1. Each maneuver is nearly instantaneous, as the time interval necessary to complete the sail reorientation is negligible with respect to the characteristic mission time. Such a Modulated Radial Thrust (MRT)</p>
	<p>It is shown that the corresponding control law consists in setting the thrust on as long as the sail moves away from the Sun, and setting it to <measure type="value">zero</measure> when the sailcraft approaches the Sun. As a special case of the above strategy, the escape problem for a propelled trajectory is investigated. It is well known that, for a solar sail subjected to a CRT, there exists a minimum value of lightness number β min below which the sail cannot attain an escape condition (McInnes, 2003). Using an optimal MRT strategy the escape condition can be obtained even if β is substantially less than β min . Moreover, some simple analytical relationships are found that link the number of trajectory arcs with the minimum necessary value of β, the total mission time, and the minimum perihelion distance.</p>
	<p>where µ ⊙ is the Sun's gravitational parameter and r is the Sun-sailcraft distance. The value of <quantifiedObject id="d88e688a-6ca3-4839-b422-710c284f064e">the lightness number</quantifiedObject> β &lt; <measure type="interval" ptr="#d88e688a-6ca3-4839-b422-710c284f064e">1</measure> quantifies the sailcraft performance and is a function of the sail reflecting area, the total spacecraft mass and the optical properties of the reflective film (Wright, 1992;).</p>
	<p>An equivalent parameter that can be used to quantify the performance of a solar sail is the characteristic acceleration a c , i.e., the maximum propelling acceleration at <measure type="value" ptr="#5f4f0a87-27a2-4f90-b7bb-c25b3b6deb24">1 AU</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5f4f0a87-27a2-4f90-b7bb-c25b3b6deb24">distance from</quantifiedObject> the Sun. Substituting</p>
	<p>During a propelled arc the sailcraft describes a <measure type="value">two</measure>-body motion subjected to a reduced gravitational parameter 񮽙 µ ⊙ given by (McInnes, 2003)</p>
	<p>With the symbology of Fig. 2, k = <measure type="value">0</measure> corresponds to the starting sailcraft orbit with eccentricity e 0 and semimajor axis a 0 , while k = <measure type="value">1</measure> is the first propelled arc. Consider the problem of finding the value of a 1 , that is, the semimajor axis of the orbit in the first phase. Let r 0 ∈ a 0 [(1 − e 0 ), (1 + e 0 )] be the sailcraft distance at which the maneuver is performed. From the mechanical energy equation one obtains:</p>
	<p>Because 2 a 0 /r 0 &gt; <measure type="interval">1</measure>, Eq. (5) implies that a C-P maneuver increases the semimajor axis (that is, a 1 &gt; a 0 ).</p>
	<p>From Eqs. (5) and (8) the orbital characteristics of the first arc are closely related to the value of β and to the distance r 0 at which the maneuver is performed. Consider now the second arc k = <measure type="value">2</measure> (a coasting arc, see Fig. 2) and assume that the second maneuver is performed at a solar distance r 1 ≥ a 1 (1 − e 1 ).</p>
	<p>In this case, because 2 a 1 /r 1 &gt; <measure type="interval">1</measure>, a P-C maneuver implies a reduction of the semimajor axis (a 2 &lt; a 1 ).</p>
	<p>Equation (10) shows that a 2 /a 0 can be either positive or negative, depending on the magnitude of the second term in the denominator (the latter is a function of r 0 and r 1 , that is, of the points at which the <measure type="value" ptr="#244d7002-6e17-4365-8eb4-f465962f73cd">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="244d7002-6e17-4365-8eb4-f465962f73cd">maneuvers</quantifiedObject> are performed). From the angular momentum conservation one has</p>

	<p>where c 񮽙 = <measure type="value">0</measure> is a constant parameter. The sign of c depends on the transversality condition. When the problem is to maximizing the final specific mechanical energy E, the transversality condition is (Bryson and Ho, 1975;Stengel, 1994):</p>
	<p>The previous relationships state that when F n = F max n , the sail must provide a propelling thrust as long as the sailcraft moves away from the Sun and that the thrust must be set to <measure type="value">zero</measure> when the sailcraft approaches the Sun. The opposite happens when F n = F min n (the thrust is set to <measure type="value">zero</measure> when the sailcraft moves away and is set on when it approaches the Sun). Note that Eq. (29) is a special case of the optimal control law for both an ideal sail model (Sauer, 1976), and a solar sail with optical force model Mengali and Quarta, 2005b,c;Dachwald et al., 2006a).</p>
	<p>The particular structure of the above equations provides an immediate generalization to a generic value of <quantifiedObject id="f0ffe334-f7e3-4899-9434-b6110163897a">k</quantifiedObject> ≥ <measure type="interval" ptr="#f0ffe334-f7e3-4899-9434-b6110163897a">1</measure>. The result is:</p>
	<p>Equation (39) links in a simple and effective way the minimum sailcraft performance required to reach an escape condition with the eccentricity of the parking orbit e 0 and the number of trajectory arcs n. Note that the same result can be found also from Eq. (36) (with k = n and n odd), by setting the denominator to <measure type="value">zero</measure>.</p>
	<p>where r ⊕ 񮽙 <measure type="value">1 AU</measure> and 񮽙 Θ 񮽙 <measure type="value">263.56 K</measure> is a reference temperature depending on the optical properties of the reflecting material (McInnes, 1999). Because during the mission the sail temperature cannot exceed a given sail film maximum tolerable limit Θ lim (Mengali and Quarta, 2009b), upon combining Eqs. (42) and (44) one obtains the following relationship involving an upper limit on n:</p>
	<p>Assuming a parking orbit equal to the Earth's heliocentric orbit, that is, a 0 = a ⊕ 񮽙 <measure type="value" ptr="#2ba1405b-479b-447b-8018-90ed0fdcc570">1 AU</measure> and e 0 = e ⊕ 񮽙 0.01671, with <quantifiedObject id="2ba1405b-479b-447b-8018-90ed0fdcc570">the aid of</quantifiedObject> the previous relationships the results summarized in Table 1 are obtained. In this and all of the examples discussed below the total mission time is constrained to not exceed <measure type="value">15 years</measure>.</p>
	<p>The information summarized in Table 1 allows one to find a compromise solution between the flight time and the minimum lightness number required to obtain an escape from the Solar System with a sailcraft deployment on a parabolic Earth-escape trajectory, that is, with <measure type="value" ptr="#f290505a-b462-4286-a7b1-a392e44d3fce">zero</measure> <quantifiedObject id="f290505a-b462-4286-a7b1-a392e44d3fce">hyperbolic excess energy</quantifiedObject> with respect to the planet.

(43) the minimum peri-</p>
	<p>Note, in passing, that Eq. (46) coincides with the locally optimal control law, that is, the control law that maximizes the time derivative of the specific mechanical energy (Macdonald and McInnes, 2005;Macdonald et al., 2007;Quarta, 2004, 2005a). The simulation results for n = <measure type="value">3</measure> have been summarized in Fig. 3. In the figure the specific mechanical energy E (which is made dimensionless with its initial value E 0 񮽙 −µ ⊙ /(2 a 0 )) during the propelled arcs is calculated by taking into account the reduced gravitational parameter, that is:</p>
	<p>where v is the sailcraft velocity magnitude. The specific mechanical energy, which has a stepwise behaviour, increases during any C-P maneuver. Note the consistency between the results of Table 1 shown in Fig. 3 regarding the flight time (∆t esc ≃ <measure type="value">1.849 years</measure>) and <quantifiedObject id="26fe6900-ed70-4052-ada4-47e74e8c5700">the perihelion radius</quantifiedObject> (r p ≃ <measure type="value" ptr="#26fe6900-ed70-4052-ada4-47e74e8c5700">0.66 AU</measure>).</p>
	<p>As a second example, consider now the escape problem from the heliocentric Mercury's <quantifiedObject id="e5432ced-3bcb-452a-9516-f83c453c65a0">orbit</quantifiedObject> (a 0 = a ≃ <measure type="value" ptr="#e5432ced-3bcb-452a-9516-f83c453c65a0">0.387 AU</measure> and e 0 <quantifiedObject id="0091df77-49dd-4001-b0cf-cb35cfdd9be7">= e ≃</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#0091df77-49dd-4001-b0cf-cb35cfdd9be7">0.2056</measure>). This example allows one to investigate the impact of the starting orbit eccentricity and the perihelion distance on the mission performance. However, we explicitly maintain that a direct comparison with the previous example (escape from an Earth's parking orbit) is not possible, as the following results do not take into account the transfer time from Earth's to Mercury's orbit.</p>
	<p>From Table 2, the optimal escape strategy requires a single maneuver (n = <measure type="value">1</measure>), otherwise the sail film would be exposed to a temperature greater than the limit temperature of <measure type="value" ptr="#f0d453ce-427f-4a08-9cc4-5abf95db5afc">513.15 K</measure>. For <quantifiedObject id="f0d453ce-427f-4a08-9cc4-5abf95db5afc">example</quantifiedObject>, assuming n = <measure type="value" ptr="#8b5b7033-6a84-4a7f-8c2b-a0c8be4066a8">11</measure>, the minimum lightness number required to reach an escape condition is <quantifiedObject id="3756b57b-e134-4a6c-803a-0d207d182413">β ⋆ esc</quantifiedObject> ≃ <measure type="value" ptr="#3756b57b-e134-4a6c-803a-0d207d182413">0.066</measure> only, see Table 2 Optimal performances for a Solar System escape starting from the Mercury's heliocentric orbit.</p>
	<p>Eq. (39), and the total flight time is about <measure type="value">3.7 years</measure>. However, the corresponding maximum temperature is Θ max ≃ <measure type="value">591.5 K</measure> and the resulting trajectory is rather complex, as shown in Fig. 5. Note that, as a consequence of Eq. (15), for all of the conic arcs the semilatus rectum is constant and, accordingly, all the arcs intersect at <measure type="value" ptr="#1b5636dd-63fb-40ff-b5f3-76ed05a9acb1">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="1b5636dd-63fb-40ff-b5f3-76ed05a9acb1">points</quantifiedObject>. As previously pointed out, an increase of the number of trajectory arcs implies a decrease of both the minimum perihelion distance and the minimum characteristic acceleration required to attain an escape condition. Such a behavior is essentially due to the substantial increase of radial acceleration that a sailcraft experiences when it approaches the Sun. For comparative purposes, it is possible to calculate the performance of a CRT spacecraft with constant thrust using the mathematical model discussed in Quarta and Mengali (2009). It can be verified that, the total flight time being the same, the characteristic acceleration required by a solar sail is much smaller than that of a CRT spacecraft. For example, assuming a flight time of <measure type="value">3.7012 years</measure>, a CRT spacecraft requires a characteristic acceleration a c = <measure type="value">1.162 mm/s 2</measure> to reach an escape condition, against about <measure type="value" ptr="#e3e2a6dd-a40e-43cf-8e32-b2407f470437">0.4 mm/s 2</measure> of a solar sail spacecraft, see Tab. 2.</p>
	<p>As a second scenario, consider now a mission whose aim is to reach a final Keplerian orbit with a given (finite) value of semimajor axis a <quantifiedObject id="6e569519-2371-40fa-9166-4da541b69b06">f &gt;</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#6e569519-2371-40fa-9166-4da541b69b06">0</measure>, starting from a parking orbit with semimajor axis a 0 and eccentricity e 0 ∈ [<measure type="value">0</measure>, <measure type="value">1</measure>). The problem here is to find the minimum value of β required to accomplish such a mission. Recall from Eqs. (14) and (16) that the final orbit eccentricity is univocally obtained as a function of a f . Assume that the (final) n−th trajectory arc starts with a P-C maneuver and that the sailcraft, once reached the final orbit, jettisons the propulsion system. This scenario corresponds to a transfer orbit constituted by an even number n of elliptical arcs. Recalling from Eq. (15) that p f = p 0 , the final eccentricity is</p>
	<p>if n is odd (53) Note that, if a f &lt; a 0 , Eq. (52) implies that F min n &lt; <measure type="interval">0</measure>. From Eq. (53) this is possible only provided that</p>
	<p>The above results can be used to investigate, for example, the minimum performance necessary to reach a heliocentric distance equal to the semimajor axis of Mars<quantifiedObject id="cafe56a9-077e-44d7-a6b0-f198828e325f">' orbit</quantifiedObject> (r a = a ♂ ≃ <measure type="value" ptr="#cafe56a9-077e-44d7-a6b0-f198828e325f">1.523 AU</measure>) or to the semimajor axis of Jupiter's <quantifiedObject id="d7ecc1b2-fda0-4d1e-a269-d28b8683f886">orbit</quantifiedObject> (r a = a ≃ <measure type="value" ptr="#d7ecc1b2-fda0-4d1e-a269-d28b8683f886">5.203 AU</measure>), starting from an Earth's heliocentric orbit (a 0 = a ⊕ and e 0 = e ⊕ ). These examples are representative of flyby missions towards an outer planet under the assumption that both the inclination and the eccentricity of the target planet orbit are neglected.</p>
	<p>The mission performance for these <measure type="value" ptr="#5b27fb65-e364-4393-aa29-c87f84f5f683">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5b27fb65-e364-4393-aa29-c87f84f5f683">cases</quantifiedObject> are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 as a function of n. The tables show that although in both cases the minimum perihelion distance is tolerable, unfortunately the flight times for a mission to Jupiter are rather long. In fact the optimal trajectory (that is, with a minimum value of β) when n = <measure type="value">2</measure> needs a flight time of about ∆t a f = <measure type="value" ptr="#8df68c97-2f90-4ff9-b4c9-c6f1dca80908">3.5 years</measure> with a lightness number <quantifiedObject id="4215eb3f-ab25-44cc-8dda-1bb0ee891b1b">The optimal trajectory for</quantifiedObject> a Mars flyby, with n = <measure type="value" ptr="#4215eb3f-ab25-44cc-8dda-1bb0ee891b1b">2</measure> and n = <measure type="value" ptr="#adbc7edb-c848-4202-99f9-9f584cba9124">8</measure> is shown in Fig. 6. Note that if n = <measure type="value">2</measure>, see Fig. 6(a), the sailcraft transfer is close to a more familiar circle-to-circle Hohmann transfer (recall that <quantifiedObject id="8128a53a-8135-42ca-ad72-ebb8ff5d8a14">e ⊕ ≪</quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#8128a53a-8135-42ca-ad72-ebb8ff5d8a14">1</measure>). According to McInnes (2003), when n = <measure type="value" ptr="#7fb6d1cd-9230-4cd0-a2fd-6b702dc20533">2</measure> <quantifiedObject id="7fb6d1cd-9230-4cd0-a2fd-6b702dc20533">the sailcraft trajectory</quantifiedObject> shows one propelled arc only, which connects the initial and final circular orbits in a quasi-Hohmann fashion. In fact, from Eqs. (50) and (54), the corresponding lightness number</p>
	<p>When the number of arcs increases, see Fig. 6(<quantifiedObject id="87aba2e6-41a3-418d-a8b8-4e0ce9eda8c3">b</quantifiedObject>) where n = <measure type="value" ptr="#87aba2e6-41a3-418d-a8b8-4e0ce9eda8c3">8</measure>, the transfer trajectory becomes more involved but the aphelion still lies on the final target orbit. Note that the change from n = <measure type="value">2</measure> to n = <measure type="value" ptr="#264a29aa-9606-43f1-8428-094d02bc753c">8</measure> in an Earth-Mars flyby mission, entails a saving of about <measure type="value" ptr="#1f021f53-2f3f-4f13-9cc6-416918b66d5e">75%</measure> in the lightness number and an increase of <measure type="value" ptr="#a861ff19-cfde-49ed-9785-dae67e69c038">410%</measure> in the flight time, see Table 3. The same reduction in β ⋆ <quantifiedObject id="2fda395a-0f8d-400a-91db-c0302cbddad4">a f (</quantifiedObject>) occurs in an Earth-Jupiter flyby mission, see Figure 7, when the strategy switches from n = <measure type="value">2</measure> to n = <measure type="value">8</measure>, whereas the flight time doubles.</p>
	<p>A further interesting employment of the above theory is given by the creation of an orbital resonance with the departure orbit. Resonant orbits can be used for scientific purposes or to generate multiple flyby maneuvers with Earth. An example is shown in Table 5, which summarizes the optimal performance required to reach a <measure type="value" ptr="#be6e1035-0e87-4884-ab4f-26b1902157a6">1</measure>:2 <quantifiedObject id="be6e1035-0e87-4884-ab4f-26b1902157a6">resonant orbit</quantifiedObject>, having a semimajor axis equal to a f = 3 √ 4 a ⊕ = <measure type="value">1.5874 AU</measure>. The resulting resonant orbit and the transfer trajectory towards that orbit are illustrated in Fig. 8.</p>
	<p>The dynamics of a sailcraft subjected to a modulated radial thrust, whose magnitude varies as the inverse square distance from the primary body, have been thoroughly studied. When the thrust is on, the sailcraft experiences a gravitational force whose magnitude is reduced with respect to the local solar Table 5 Optimal performance to reach a <measure type="value">1</measure>:<measure type="value">2</measure> Earth resonant orbit (a f = <measure type="value">1.5874 AU</measure>).</p></text>
