	<p>Modern enzyme complexes are elaborate molecular machineries that have been optimized in the course of evolution for the efficient and specific processing of their substrates. One prominent example is the imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (ImGP-S), a bi-enzyme complex which belongs to the family of glutamine amidotransferases 1 and constitutes a branch-point connecting amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis. ImGP-S consists of the cyclase subunit HisF and the glutaminase subunit HisH. HisF binds the substrate PRFAR and performs a cycloligase/lyase reaction that generates ImGP and AICAR, which are further used in histidine and de novo purine biosynthesis, respectively 2 ( Figure 1). The ammonia molecule required for this transformation is produced by the glutaminase subunit HisH and transported to the active site of HisF through an extended molecular channel. This channeling hampers diffusion of ammonia into bulk solvent and thus presumably prevents its protonation to the non-productive ammonium ion. Another special feature of the HisF/HisH complex is the tight coordination of the <measure type="value" ptr="#5ed69db3-330d-429c-bc9c-0cf1a31ff009">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5ed69db3-330d-429c-bc9c-0cf1a31ff009">enzymatic activities</quantifiedObject>: Binding of PRFAR (or its analogue N′-[(5′-phosphoribosyl) formimino] -5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-ribonucleotide; ProFAR) to HisF results in an allosteric signal that leads to a <measure type="value" ptr="#ff72e0e2-04b3-4172-86c1-b2ae314fb1b1">several hundred</measure>-fold <quantifiedObject id="ff72e0e2-04b3-4172-86c1-b2ae314fb1b1">stimulation of</quantifiedObject> the glutaminase activity of HisH [3][4][5] . This property precludes the hydrolysis of glutamine by HisH in the absence of an acceptor substrate at the active site of HisF 6</p>
	<p>We were interested to find out whether the characteristics of modern HisF enzymes were already present in those species that colonized earth in a very early phase of biological evolution. A straightforward answer to this question is difficult due to the lack of macromolecular fossils. However, computational techniques of amino acid sequence reconstruction 7,8 make it possible to travel back in time and to study extinct proteins [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] . In extreme cases, these algorithms enable us to study enzymes from the last universal common ancestor of cellular organisms (LUCA), which preceded the diversification of life and existed in the Paleoarchean era, i. e. at least <measure type="value">3.8 billion years</measure> (Gyr) and presumably <measure type="value" ptr="#689b36f9-b7c9-4f2b-b6be-5e42fa2103ba">4.5 Gyr</measure> ago <measure type="value" ptr="#8936aeb3-b938-4c73-9c41-2466fd477edb">17</measure> .</p>
	<p>Along these lines, we have previously computationally reconstructed the amino acid sequence of HisF from the LUCA era (LUCA-HisF) 18 . To this end, a set of <measure type="value">87</measure> extant HisF and HisH proteins from the <measure type="value" ptr="#a796e5fd-dd52-417c-9de6-6ca8ca7fe08b">seven</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a796e5fd-dd52-417c-9de6-6ca8ca7fe08b">phylogenetic clades</quantifiedObject> Crenarchaeota, Actinobacteria, Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Thermotogae has been used to determine a phylogenetic tree t HisF_HisH based on the CAT model 19 ( Figure 1).

Thus, although the precise lineage of the <measure type="value">three</measure> -2 - Figure 1. Reaction catalyzed by the heterodimeric ImGP synthase complex. The synthase subunit HisF catalyzes the reaction of N`-[(5`phosphoribulosyl)formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-ribonucleotide (PRFAR) with ammonia (NH 3 ) to imidazole glycerol phosphate (ImGP) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (AICAR). ImGP is further utilized in the synthesis of histidine, whereas AICAR is an intermediate in de novo purine biosynthesis, rendering HisF a branch-point enzyme of amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis. The ammonia molecule required for the HisF reaction is produced by the glutaminase subunit HisH (catalytic triad residues are depicted as spheres) and subsequently channeled to the active site of HisF (catalytic aspartate residues are depicted as spheres). In the absence of HisH, HisF can also use external ammonia that is added as ammonia salts. HisF adopts the () 8 -barrel fold, an ubiquitous and catalytically versatile protein architecture 21 , which is considered one of the <measure type="value" ptr="#a687a326-2fb6-4123-9f6a-78aee0d868a6">three</measure> most <quantifiedObject id="a687a326-2fb6-4123-9f6a-78aee0d868a6">ancient protein folds</quantifiedObject> 22 .

	<p>Cloning, expression, and purification of LUCA-HisF. The gene coding for LUCA-HisF was optimized for its expression in E. coli, synthesized (GeneArt), and cloned into the vector pET24a(+)(Stratagene) using the terminal restriction sites for NdeI and XhoI. Since the addition of a C-terminal hexahistidine tag to LUCA-HisF might influence its interaction with HisH proteins, a stop codon was integrated at the end of the gene. The gene was expressed in E. coli T7-Express cells (New England Biolabs) transformed with pET24a(+)-LUCA-hisF.

	<p>Sequence reconstruction, cloning, expression and purification of LUCA-HisH. As for LUCA-HisF, the reconstruction of LUCA-HisH was based on the tree t HisF_HisH (Figure S1), which is close to an accepted organism phylogeny. In comparison to the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of extant HisF sequences, the <measure type="value">87</measure> extant HisH sequences exhibit a significantly higher variability. In fact, <measure type="value" ptr="#b8012b9f-7100-43e6-ba72-7445215b7166">140</measure> of 226 <quantifiedObject id="b8012b9f-7100-43e6-ba72-7445215b7166">residues</quantifiedObject> are less than <measure type="interval">50 %</measure> conserved. Furthermore, the MSA (HisH ext ) contains several gaps. Recently, it has been shown that a novel algorithm for the phylogeny-aware gap placement named PRANK 29 improves MSA quality. This is why we used PRANK with the option -showanc to deduce LUCA-HisH from the MSA HisH ext under the control of t HisF_HisH ( Figure S2). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of LUCA-HisH are given in the Supporting Information. The protein shares <measure type="value" ptr="#81e5101a-9383-4057-8268-2d0c44da7b67">123</measure> of 226 <quantifiedObject id="81e5101a-9383-4057-8268-2d0c44da7b67">residues</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value">54%</measure>) with the closest BLAST 27 match, which is HisH from Syntrophothermus lipocalidus.</p>

	<p>Stability and folding mechanism of LUCA-HisF. The thermal stability of LUCA-HisF was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which monitors overall unfolding, and the heat-induced decrease of the far-UV CD signal, which indicates the loss of secondary structure.

These results characterize LUCA-HisF as an enzyme with a high resistance to heat. Interestingly, even higher denaturation temperatures were previously observed for enzymes from the common ancestors of Bacteria, Archaea and Archaea/Eukaryota 16 . These findings and our results are in agreement with rRNA and protein sequence analyses which have provided independent support for the increase of thermotolerance from the LUCA to the ancestors of Bacteria and Archaea-Eukaryota</p>
	<p>. Furthermore, the conformational stability of LUCA-HisF was analyzed by GdmCl-induced equilibrium unfolding and refolding transitions. The loss or gain of tertiary structure was probed by protein (Tyr/Trp) fluorescence.

LUCA-HisF has a lower G D but a comparably high mvalue as tmHisF and its artificially <quantifiedObject id="028d3001-c919-4392-b72e-529e1cf50250">designed precursors Sym1 and</quantifiedObject> Sym<measure type="interval" ptr="#028d3001-c919-4392-b72e-529e1cf50250">2 39</measure>,40 , indicating that it is comparably compact as these proteins but less stable ( Figure S4A, Table S2). Folding and unfolding kinetics followed by Tyr/Trp fluorescence, showed that the reduced stability of LUCA-HisF is due to strongly increased unfolding rates of LUCA-HisF in comparison to tmHisF ( Figure S5A). The comparison of the refolding kinetics of LUCA-HisF, tmHisF, Sym1, and Sym2 followed by fluorescence and far-UV CD (Supporting Information) showed that all <measure type="value" ptr="#bd42dbfd-3b76-48aa-a6a2-894815de8a60">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="bd42dbfd-3b76-48aa-a6a2-894815de8a60">proteins</quantifiedObject> share a common sequential folding mechanism including a non-productive burst-phase intermediate ( Figure S4B) and <measure type="value" ptr="#1f0edae3-9e60-4399-8089-70893429e3b6">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="1f0edae3-9e60-4399-8089-70893429e3b6">productive intermediates</quantifiedObject> ( Figure S5). The rate-limiting step that synchronizes folding is conserved ( Figure S6). (Table 1). As ancient enzymes have been proposed to be less specific (more promiscuous) than their modern descendants 57 , we tested LUCA-HisF for its ability to catalyze related metabolic reactions. The homologous enzyme HisA, which precedes HisF in the histidine biosynthesis pathway, catalyzes the Amadori rearrangement of ProFAR to PRFAR. HisA shares with HisF the overall () 8 -barrel fold as well as the location of the <measure type="value" ptr="#dc8e92a6-08af-4648-a646-aa138fe88e9a">two</measure> symmetry-<quantifiedObject id="dc8e92a6-08af-4648-a646-aa138fe88e9a">related catalytic aspartate residues and</quantifiedObject> phosphate binding sites 52 . Phosphoribosyl anthranilate (PRA) isomerase (TrpF) catalyzes an Amadori rearrangement in tryptophan biosynthesis analogous to HisA in histidine biosynthesis 49 . Remarkably, a single amino acid exchange in the HisA and HisF proteins from T. maritima leads to TrpF activity, suggesting that these <measure type="value" ptr="#9ba90710-c0e1-46d0-977f-e2b5fb5841b2">three</measure> phosphate-binding () 8 -<quantifiedObject id="9ba90710-c0e1-46d0-977f-e2b5fb5841b2">barrel proteins</quantifiedObject> have evolved from a common precursor 48,58 . We examined LUCA-HisF for the isomerisation activity towards ProFAR and PRA. However, no substrate turnover could be detected, even in the presence of <measure type="value" ptr="#fb777733-a073-4d38-be84-eb7d637599bf">50 µM</measure> <quantifiedObject id="fb777733-a073-4d38-be84-eb7d637599bf">protein</quantifiedObject>. These findings were complemented by assessing catalytic activity in vivo using metabolic selection. For this purpose, a plasmid harboring the LUCA-HisF gene was used to transform auxotrophic E. coli strains lacking either the intrinsic hisF, hisA, or trpF gene. When plated on minimal medium without histidine or tryptophan, the hisF cells formed visible colonies within <measure type="value">24 hours</measure>, whereas the hisA and trpF cells did not grow within one week. Taken together, these results demonstrate that LUCA-HisF is a monofunctional enzyme.</p>
	<p>whether LUCA-HisF contains all structural elements required for complex formation, substrate channeling and allosteric communication, we assayed its functional interaction with the extant zmHisH enzyme from Zymomonas mobilis. For this purpose, zmHisH was produced in E. coli and purified. The binding of zmHisH to LUCA-HisF was analyzed via fluorescence titration 5 , which showed that the <measure type="value" ptr="#b0fc214a-4eb8-4f0f-8c57-bcea3933d7a2">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b0fc214a-4eb8-4f0f-8c57-bcea3933d7a2">proteins</quantifiedObject> form a stoichiometric complex with a thermodynamic dissociation constant (K D ) of <measure type="value">113 nM</measure> ( Figure 4A).</p>
	<p>The steady-state kinetic constants k cat and K M PRFAR of LUCAHisF in presence of zmHisH and saturating concentrations of glutamine (glutamine-dependent cyclase activity) compare well with the above reported ammonia-dependent cyclase activity (Table 1). This outcome confirms the functionality of the LUCA-HisF/zmHisH complex, as ammonia produced at the active site of HisH by means of glutamine hydrolysis is used as efficiently by LUCA-HisF as externally added ammonia. Moreover, this finding suggests that ammonia is transported from HisH to the active site of the synthase through a molecular channel formed by the central -barrel of HisF- (A) LUCA-HisF_W138Y+W156Y was added to <measure type="interval" ptr="#02802894-88e8-4d39-8d00-b6bad90a3456">7 μM</measure> <quantifiedObject id="02802894-88e8-4d39-8d00-b6bad90a3456">zmHisH</quantifiedObject> in <measure type="value">50 mM</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b2a268b3-f7ae-47e3-90dd-6cd179044742">potassium phosphate</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#b2a268b3-f7ae-47e3-90dd-6cd179044742">, pH7.5, 25</measure> °C. <quantifiedObject id="6689d1e0-e6a1-420a-89c8-8ee137c062c3">Fluorescence emission at</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#6689d1e0-e6a1-420a-89c8-8ee137c062c3">318 nm</measure> was determined following <quantifiedObject id="97dca4ba-4356-417f-8266-a182b957b58c">excitation at</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#97dca4ba-4356-417f-8266-a182b957b58c">295 nm</measure>.

	<p>LUCA, as observed for extant HisF enzymes 43,59 . Furthermore, glutamine hydrolysis by zmHisH in presence of LUCAHisF and saturating concentrations of the substrate analogue ProFAR (glutaminase activity) is as efficient as glutaminase activity of HisH from T. maritima (tmHisH) in complex with ProFAR-liganded tmHisF 4 (Table 1). The comparison of the zmHisH activity in the presence and absence of ProFAR indicates a <measure type="value">13</measure>-fold stimulation by the HisF-ligand in <quantifiedObject id="4a8978be-f7d1-4b68-99fb-9a1470243d2c">this nonnative complex</quantifiedObject> ( Figure 4B), which is <measure type="interval" ptr="#4a8978be-f7d1-4b68-99fb-9a1470243d2c">23</measure>-fold lower than the stimulating effect of ProFAR in the native tmHisF/tmHisH complex (Table 1).</p>
	<p>Following the characterization of LUCA-HisF, we also reconstructed the amino acid sequence of the corresponding glutaminase LUCA-HisH. Again, we used the tree t HisF_HisH , but opted for the phylogeny-aware gap placement of PRANK 29 to deduce LUCA-HisH from the MSA HisH ext , which contains several insertions and deletions. The gene coding for LUCAHisH was synthesized, cloned into a plasmid, and expressed in E. coli. The produced protein was soluble and could be purified by a combination of heat denaturation and Ni 2+ affinity chromatography. As observed for LUCA-HisF, LUCAHisH exhibits a high thermotolerance. Unfolding followed by CD resulted in a single transition with <quantifiedObject id="f13563af-3afe-4732-a1e8-1db694cbf192">a midpoint of</quantifiedObject> about <measure type="value" ptr="#f13563af-3afe-4732-a1e8-1db694cbf192">79 °C</measure> ( Figure S3C). Complex formation between LUCA-HisH and LUCA-HisF was probed by fluorescence titration 5 . Both proteins interacted stoichiometrically with very high affinity as demonstrated by a K <quantifiedObject id="51d56bcc-fa38-495e-908e-208140df7462">D value of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#51d56bcc-fa38-495e-908e-208140df7462">4 nM</measure> ( Figure 4C). However, when testing the LUCA-HisF/LUCA-HisH complex for glutamine-dependent cyclase activity or LUCA-HisH for the hydrolysis of glutamine in the presence of LUCA-HisF and saturating concentrations of ProFAR, no enzymatic turnover could be determined. Thus, other than LUCA-HisF, LUCAHisH is catalytically inactive. As outlined in the following, uncertainties in the reconstruction process are probably responsible for this finding.</p>
	<p>The evolutionary models underlying reconstruction consider each residue-position independently of all other positions. Thus, the reliability of a given reconstruction is not limited by sequence length, but by the composition of the MSA and the topology of the deduced phylogenetic tree. In the case of LUCA-HisF, 49 out of <measure type="value" ptr="#ffa883b6-7985-4f46-b878-d5f42326a0ef">250</measure> <quantifiedObject id="ffa883b6-7985-4f46-b878-d5f42326a0ef">residues</quantifiedObject> are strictly conserved, among them are the <measure type="value" ptr="#f0cc20ca-f404-4bbf-b1ad-e9b91f93b000">two</measure> active site aspartate residues 5 and <quantifiedObject id="f0cc20ca-f404-4bbf-b1ad-e9b91f93b000">amino acids contributing</quantifiedObject> to the central ammonia channel 38,43 ( Figure 2). Furthermore, the <measure type="value" ptr="#a2328ef3-3d0a-4bdf-9ccf-739218aa1aaf">four</measure> <quantifiedObject id="a2328ef3-3d0a-4bdf-9ccf-739218aa1aaf">central nodes of</quantifiedObject> t HisF_HisH ( Figure S1) possess posterior probabilities ≥ <measure type="interval">0.88</measure>. Taken together, these features suggest that tree topology and choice of the most likely residues for the corresponding predecessors and LUCA-HisF is largely unambiguous. In contrast, in the case of LUCA-HisH, only <measure type="value" ptr="#0827ed50-173b-4444-b385-92057c5e63d0">21 out of 226</measure> <quantifiedObject id="0827ed50-173b-4444-b385-92057c5e63d0">residues</quantifiedObject> are strictly conserved, which makes the reconstruction much more prone to uncertainties.</p>
	<p>Taken together, LUCA-HisF, which presumably existed about <measure type="value">4 billion years</measure> ago, is similar to extant HisF proteins with respect to structure, stability, folding, and activity. Since similar results were obtained for predecessors of thioredoxin, 16 .experimental evidence accumulates for the existence of highly effective and non-promiscuous enzymes in the LUCA era. In addition, LUCA-HisF forms a stable complex with LUCA-HisH and a functional enzyme complex with the extant glutaminase zmHisH. It is therefore plausible to assume that the evolution of the ImGP-S complex, including ammonia channeling and allosteric communication, has been completed in the LUCA era. Thus, our experimental findings are in line with the hypothesis that the LUCA had already a rather diverse metabolism, which was as sophisticated as are the metabolisms of its archaeal and bacterial successors 60 .</p>
