		<p>Marine and freshwater photosynthetic microalgae have the ability to assimilate inorganic dissolved carbon into organic matter. These processes represent massive fluxes on earth where <measure type="value"><num>one</num></measure> third of the atmospheric CO 2 emitted by human activities is absorbed by phytoplankton ( Sabine et al., 2004). The idea to reproduce and intensify this natural process to mitigate industrial emissions of CO 2 is more and more considered, with potential biomass valorization through lipid or carbohydrate storage (Abd El Baky et al., 2012). As phytoplankton is diluted in natural biotopes, the dissolved inorganic carbon generally does not limit primary production, which is mostly controlled by photon and nutrient fluxes. This is not the case for intensive microalgae cultivation devices such as high rate ponds or photobioreactors, where the high biomass concentrations require the supply of large amounts of inorganic carbon, as gaseous CO 2 or bicarbonate.</p>
		<p>The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using cement-plant flue gas as a source of CO 2 for microalgae cultivation. The cement process can be represented as a counter-current flow of matter and gas: the raw materials enter the process at ambient temperature and are continuously heated by the counter-current flow of hot gases produced by the burner at the end of the furnace. The gases then pass through filters before being exhaust at the chimney around <measure type="value"><num>120</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure>. The dust collected at this stage proceeds from the whole process, and is composed of both un-reacted and partially reacted raw matter, clinker and dust of combustion. It follows that the Cement Flue Gas (CFG) comprises <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> gaseous and solid components, also known as cement kiln dust. Potentially toxic compounds such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen and sulfur oxides are often present in the gaseous part of the CFG. It is therefore necessary to 3 evaluate their effects on algal physiology, and the corresponding tolerance threshold for phytoplankton. Carbon monoxide, at <measure type="value"><num>3</num> <measure type="CONCENTRATION" unit="ppm">ppm</measure></measure>, was proven to be without effect on microalgae ( Doucha et al., 2005). Moderate SOx and NOx contents (a <measure type="value"><num>few tens</num></measure> of ppm) can be tolerated by microalgae (Brown, 1996;Lee et al., 2000Lee et al., , 2002). But higher concentrations have been shown to have moderate ( Negoro et al., 1993) to strong inhibiting effects ( Yanagi et al., 1995) on microalgae production, depending on culture conditions and species. The causes of toxicity are not always easy to highlight, as these molecules can act directly on the organism physiology, or indirectly by altering the properties of their medium. For example, the deleterious effects of SOx ( Matsumoto et al., 1997) and NOx (Jin et al., 2005;Lee et al., 2002) can be significantly attenuated if the pH of the media is regulated within physiological acceptable ranges. Besides the gas itself, dust can contain potentially detrimental compounds, such as soot ( Matsumoto et al., 1997) or trace metals (Borkenstein et al., 2011).</p>
		<p>This study is aiming at evaluating the effects of CFG, including dust, on both the growing potential and biochemical composition of photosynthetic microorganisms. A fully controlled culturing device was used to regulate the gaseous flow rate in the culture, through pH adjustment ( Sciandra et al., 2003). <measure type="value"><num>Four</num></measure> phytoplankton species were used for the experiments: Dunaliella tertiolecta, Chlorella vulgaris, Thalassiosira weissflogii, and Isochrysis galbana, in order to assess the CFG impact on different phyla. 4</p>
		<p><measure type="value"><num>Four</num></measure> autotrophic microalgae were selected (Table 1). The choice was driven first by the desire of using a panel of species belonging to: 1) different phyla, 2) different biotopes (seawater vs. fresh water), 3) different industrial applications, and second, by the suitability of these species to be to grown properly in photobioreactors within long term experiments. The culture vessels consisted of water-jacketed 2-liter cylinders connected to a circulating water bath that maintain constant temperature of <measure type="value"><num>25±0.1</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure>. Plexiglas lid, fitted with a toric seal, insured a hermetic closure of bioreactors. Glass tubes, passing through the lid, allow exchanges of fluids and gas, and sampling for analysis.</p>
		<p>Cultures were subject to continuous gentle stirring and bubbling with sterile-filtered air, which passed through a 0.2-µm Whatman filter and activated charcoal. The entire culture system and its analytical resources are detailed in Sciandra et al. (2000) and Stramski et al. (2002). For marine species, the growth medium was prepared using <measure type="value"><num>0.2</num><measure type="LENGTH" unit="µm">µm</measure></measure> Millipore filtered and autoclaved (<measure type="value"><num>110</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure> for <measure type="value"><num>20</num><measure type="TIME" unit="min">min</measure></measure>) seawater and nutrient enrichment according to f/2 formulation (Guillard and Ryther, 1962). For freshwater species, the culture medium was prepared from autoclaved (<measure type="value"><num>110</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure> for <measure type="value"><num>20</num><measure type="TIME" unit="min">min</measure></measure>) demineralized water, enriched with BG11 broth, trace metals, and vitamins according to Rippka et al. (1979). After cooling and sterile addition of nutrients, the medium was transferred to the culture vessels through a 0.22-µm sterile filter (Sartobran-300, Sartorius Stedim), using a peristaltic pump (Gilson 3). Flow rate was regularly controlled by weighing the inflowing medium. The cultures were grown under continuous illumination from <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> clusters of neon tubes, which provide a high output of radiations in the whole visible spectra ( Bruyant et al., 2001 5 radiation (PAR) was measured with a quantum scalar irradiance meter (QSL-100, Biospherical Instruments) by immersing the spherical collector in the cultures.</p>
		<p>Measurements of PAR before and after additions of dust solution into the cultures (see below) showed that light intensity and presumably light spectrum were not modified by these additions. Inorganic carbon was provided to the cultures by controlled injections of CO 2 , using a pH-stat approach ( Sciandra et al., 2003). When the uptake of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) leads the pH to exceed a fixed value, pure CO 2 was bubbled into the chemostats to lower the pH, using solenoid valves. The pH was measured at <measure type="value"><num>0.5</num><measure type="TIME" unit="s">s</measure></measure> intervals using electrodes (Fisherbrand, gelled electrolyte) regularly calibrated.</p>
		<p>This regulation system enabled to keep a constant pH during the whole experiment. For the marine species, pH was maintained at <measure type="value"><num>8.0±0.02</num></measure>, for which the DIC concentration is not limiting for photosynthesis. For the freshwater species, pH was maintained at <measure type="value"><num>7.5±0.04</num></measure> as advised for BG-11 growth medium preparation ( Rippka et al., 1979).</p>
		<p>The mean diameter, number and total biovolume of microalgae were estimated from their size distribution measured daily with <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> particle counters (Hiac Royco-Pacific Scientific and Multisizer III-Beckman). All biochemical analyses were made in triplicates. For each replicate, <measure type="value"><num>5</num> <measure type="VOLUME" unit="ml">ml</measure></measure> of culture were filtered onto glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C, porosity <measure type="value"><num>1.2</num><measure type="LENGTH" unit="µm">µm</measure></measure>) previously burned <measure type="value"><num>4</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="hours">hours</measure></measure> at <measure type="value"><num>450</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure>. All samples were then stored at<measure type="value"><num>-20</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure> until analyses, except the filtered samples for elemental C and N analyses that were dried at <measure type="value"><num>60</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure>. Particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) were analyzed with a Perkin-Elmer CHN analyzer. Chlorophyll, extracted with a mix of <measure type="value"><num>90</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> acetone / dimethyl sulfoxide in the proportion 3:2 (v/v) (Shoaf and Lium, 6 1976) was measured with a Turner 10-AU fluorimeter (exc. 436nm; <measure type="value"><num>em. 680</num><measure type="LENGTH" unit="nm">nm</measure></measure>), following Welschmeyer (1994). Proteins were extracted and solubilized by filter sonication in a detergent buffer. The bulk proteins were measured from the absorbance measured at <measure type="value"><num>750</num> <measure type="LENGTH" unit="nm">nm</measure></measure> with a spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer UV/VIS Lambda2), after a colorimetric reaction derived from Lowry et al. (1951),kit (DC Protein Assay Kit II, ref 500-0112-MSDS). As the algae proteins do not give exactly the same signal intensity as the standard (protein BSA bovine serum albumin), data are given in BSA equivalents. Carbohydrates were measured using the colorimetric method from Sun et al. (1984). After a treatment with phenol and sulfuric acid, samples were heated at <measure type="value"><num>100</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure>, and absorbance measured between 480nm and <measure type="value"><num>490</num><measure type="LENGTH" unit="nm">nm</measure></measure> (PerkinElmer UV/VIS Lambda2).</p>
		<p>To compare the respective effects of gas and dust on the species Dunaliella tertiolecta, Chlorella vulgaris, Thalassiosira weissflogii, and Isochrysis galbana, <measure type="value"><num>four</num></measure> separate experiments with <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> parallel cultures were carried out. For each experiment, the control culture (C1) was submitted to standard, optimal growing conditions, whereas the test culture (C2) was subsequently submitted to <measure type="value"><num>three</num></measure> treatments: 1) the same conditions as in the control culture C1, 2) bubbled with CFG, and 3) provided with cement industry dust.</p>
		<p>The growth rate µ (d-1 ) for a variable x in a culture renewed with the dilution rate D (d1 ) can be estimated from measurements x 1 and x 2 made at times t 1 and t 2 respectively: The cultures were systematically inoculated at low cell concentration within batch mode (no culture renewal) to verify that the maximum division rates were in agreement with the values of the literature. It thus validated the optimality of the culture setups for each species (culturing system, axenicity, medium, temperature and light conditions). Once the algal culture reached a sufficient level of biomass, the dilution was started with a rate equal to the maximum previously measured growth rate. Using this turbidostat mode, cultures were continuously renewed with fresh medium and maintained at steady state within non-limited growth conditions. During this stabilization phase, the dilution rate could be slightly adjusted to compensate any variations of the culture level.</p>
		<p>Once the cultures were stabilized, the pure CO 2 injected into the C2 culture was replaced by a mixture composed with the major gases found in the emissions of a plant chosen for this study and stored in the same gas cylinder: N <measure type="value"><num>2 (732 943</num> <measure type="CONCENTRATION" unit="ppm">ppm</measure></measure>), CO 2 (<measure type="value"><num>167 772</num> <measure type="CONCENTRATION" unit="ppm">ppm</measure></measure>), NO (<measure type="value"><num>677</num> <measure type="CONCENTRATION" unit="ppm">ppm</measure></measure>), CO (<measure type="value"><num>568</num> <measure type="CONCENTRATION" unit="ppm">ppm</measure></measure>) and SO2 (<measure type="value"><num>41</num> <measure type="CONCENTRATION" unit="ppm">ppm</measure></measure>). Oxygen (<measure type="value"><num>98 000</num> <measure type="CONCENTRATION" unit="ppm">ppm</measure></measure>) was brought independently. C1 and C2 cultures were sampled for biochemical analyses at the end of the stabilization phase, and after the gas treatment.</p>
		<p>30 mg/Nm 3 .</p>
		<p>Considering the parameters of a classical production pond (<measure type="value"><num>1</num><measure type="?" unit="kg/m 3">kg/m 3</measure></measure> of biomass, uptake of <measure type="value"><num>1.8</num><measure type="MASS" unit="kg">kg</measure></measure> of <measure type="value"><num>CO 2</num> <measure type="?" unit="per kg">per kg</measure></measure> of biomass, half of the bubbled CO 2 being lost), assuming no dust storage within the pond (i.e. the same dilution rate than for the liquid phase), the final concentration of dust at equilibrium in the pond is <measure type="value"><num>0.33</num><measure type="?" unit="mg/L">mg/L</measure></measure>.</p>
		<p>The first experiment with the dust was carried out on the species Dunaliella tertiolecta.</p>
		<p>Once stabilized with the standard medium, the culture was successively fed with a 8 series of <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> media previously incubated with increasing concentrations of dust, and filtered. The <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> concentrations chosen for the tests were 20 and <measure type="value"><num>40</num></measure> times the estimated real concentration, more precisely <measure type="value"><num>6.8</num><measure type="MASS" unit="mg">mg</measure></measure>/L and <measure type="value"><num>13.6</num><measure type="?" unit="mg/L">mg/L</measure></measure>.</p>
		<p>The second experiment was performed with much higher concentrations of dust. Dust addition was carried out in the cultures where CFG was tested, after a period where only the artificial gas without dust was bubbled. After a first period with only gas injection, <measure type="value"><num>100</num> <measure type="?" unit="mL">mL</measure></measure> of medium previously incubated with dust (<measure type="value"><num>11</num> <measure type="?" unit="g/L">g/L</measure></measure>) and filtered, were added. It results in a final concentration of <measure type="value"><num>680</num><measure type="MASS" unit="mg">mg</measure></measure>/L, <measure type="value"><num>two thousand</num></measure> times higher than the expected concentration in a real installation. This operation was repeated for <measure type="value"><num>5</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="days">days</measure></measure>.</p>
		<p>During this phase, the control culture C1 received the same volume of growth medium. , whereas others appeared with the dust addition but remained constant (Cu, Mn, Mo and Se).</p>
		<p>Cell contents of nitrogen, chlorophyll a, proteins and carbohydrates were normalized by cell carbon to make the comparison between treatments independent from culture biomass. It follows that the result interpretation involves statistical analyses of ratios.</p>
		<p>Because the different compounds were measured on independent triplicate samples, it is not possible to calculate one single ratio by averaging the ratios of the <measure type="value"><num>three</num></measure> replicate.</p>
		<p>Instead, by considering that measurement errors were normally distributed, the mean and standard deviation of each compound concentration were computed, and the parameters of the probability density distribution of the ratio of <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> normal random variables were estimated (Hinkley, 1969). Assuming additionally that the normal distribution of each compound concentration has a nearly vanishing density at <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure>, the density of the ratio is: Whereas the ratios measured during each of the <measure type="value"><num>3</num></measure> phases of the experiments (stabilization, gas and dust treatments) could not be compared directly, the difference of ratios between the control culture C1 and test culture C2 could be. Monte Carlo <measure type="value"><num>3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 10</num></measure> simulations of the error concentration measurements shows that the differences of the ratios were normally distributed and could be therefore compared with a t-test, using Welch's approximation for the degrees of freedom to account for possibly unequal variances. The mean, variance, and sample size of each difference were computed from the mean, variance, and sample sizes of the ratios with Zar, 1999). All computations were done with the R software (R Development Core Team, 2011).</p>
		<p>The experiments showed that the CFG had noticeable effects neither on the growth rate, nor on the biochemical composition of the <measure type="value"><num>four</num></measure> algal species tested in this study. One example is given here, for the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii (similar observations were made for the <measure type="value"><num>three</num></measure> other species). Figure 1A displays that algal biomass increased rapidly in both the control (C1) and test (C2) cultures, insuring that suitable growing conditions were met for this species. On day 4, cell density expectedly started to decrease as the dilution was switched on, but the growth rate remained unchanged (turbidostat mode). After <measure type="value"><num>1</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="week">week</measure></measure> of CFG bubbling, the biomass levels were close in the C1 and C2 cultures. Note that during the CFG treatment, the rate of variation of Thalassiosira weissflogii was even slightly greater in C2 than in C1. Figure 2 (Fig. 2B) are not modified after the gas test phase. Table 3 illustrates that the same conclusion applies to the other tested species. This comparison of the <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> cultures after the stabilization phase and after the CFG treatment, for the <measure type="value"><num>four</num></measure> species, demonstrates that the gas does not have any significant impact (Table 3).</p>
		<p>The first experiment with the dust was carried out with concentrations <measure type="value"><num>20</num></measure> times and 40 times higher than the nominal dust concentration in a standard installation. Figure 1B shows that those concentrations (<measure type="value"><num>6.8</num><measure type="MASS" unit="mg">mg</measure></measure>/L and 13.6mg/L) had no harmful effect on growth rate. Indeed, no modification of the growth rate was noticed for Dunaliella tertiolecta: it was measured at <measure type="value"><num>0.50</num></measure> ± 0.06 d-1 during the stabilization phase, at <measure type="interval"><num type="base">0.47</num> ± <num type="range">0.02</num></measure> d-1 when grown with <measure type="value"><num>6.8</num><measure type="?" unit="mg/L">mg/L</measure></measure> of dust and <measure type="interval"><num type="base">0.49</num> ± <num type="range">0.06</num></measure> d-1 with <measure type="value"><num>13.6</num><measure type="MASS" unit="mg">mg</measure></measure>/L of dust.</p>
		<p>Since there was no noticeable response to dust addition, a dust shock was applied in a second experiment. The dust concentration was set to <measure type="value"><num>two thousand</num></measure> times the <measure type="value"><num>one</num></measure> expected in a CFG treating pond. As shown by the arrow II in Figure 1A, the addition of concentrated dust extracts induced an immediate decrease of the biomass in the culture.</p>
		<p>And this has been observed for the <measure type="value"><num>four</num></measure> cultivated microalgae: the growth rate decreased the day after the first injection, except for Isochrysis galbana, for which it took <measure type="value"><num>3</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="days">days</measure></measure> before any effect appeared. Nevertheless, this species showed the strongest reaction to the dust: its growth rate became even negative, reaching-1.2d-1 , indicating that the algae not only stopped dividing but were also dying. It is worth noting that this toxic effect was observed with dust concentrations 2000 times higher (i.e. 680mg/L) than the expected concentration in a real installation.</p>
		<p>The same biochemical analyses than for the CFG treatment were carried out on the cultures contaminated with 680 mg/L of dust. Table 3 shows that the introduction of concentrated dust extracts in C2 caused a significant difference on the set of measured ratios. Figure 3 details these effects for Thalassiosira weissflogii: the N/C ratio and the protein content both increased (Fig. 3A, C) whereas the chlorophyll as well as the carbohydrates decreased ( fig 3B, D). Table 3 cell content is the main regulator of the photosynthetic activity. This study shows that this regulation has a double impact on carbohydrates, as the primary product of the photosynthesis but also as an energy source supply. Thus, in case of deficient photosynthesis, the carbohydrates are produced with a poorer yield and rapidly breathed and degraded to compensate for the insufficient energetic provision of the cellular metabolic machinery. It has to be noted that the decrease of the pigment synthesis was visible during the terminal phase of the dust-treated cultures, because the microalgae bleached. As shown in Figure 1B, realistic dust concentrations in the medium have no impact on the cell growth. But when the dust concentration rises, some toxic effect appears and can even be lethal ( Figure 1A), which means that the cement dust probably contains at least one compound which becomes inhibiting for growth. Table 2 shows that among the compounds detected in the culture medium, the concentration of <measure type="value"><num>six</num></measure> of them increased with the introduction of dust in the water. As the toxic effect is only seen with high dust content, inhibition is probably due to some elements, which concentration increase with the dust concentration. Both compounds Finally, only the chemical impact of CFG was tested through the effect of the considered compounds in the gas or in the dust. However, using industrial CFG will also lead to the injection of a hot gas in the microalgal culture medium. As a consequence, an increase of temperature will be expected in the bioreactor. As shown in Bernard and Rémond, (2012), such temperature raise can benefit to the microalgae during cold period, where temperature can reduce growth, but it may have deleterious effects during the warm seasons, where inhibitory or even lethal temperatures could be reached. Adaptation mechanisms in industrial plants fed with hot CFG may however lead to the selection and development of strains which are tolerant to higher temperatures ( Ras et al. 2013).</p>
		<p>This study shows that both the outflow gas and the dust produced by a cement plant are tolerated by <measure type="value"><num>four</num></measure> species of microalgae, even though the dust can release compounds inhibiting the microalgae production at concentrations much higher than the ones that should be reached in a real case.</p>
		<p>However, these results have to be validated by experiments carried out with the real CFG including dust emitted by a cement industry plant. Such a study would also highlight a possible effect due to a temporal variability of the gas composition or of its dust content.
