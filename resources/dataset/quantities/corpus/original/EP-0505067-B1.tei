body from fine particles such as powder, whiskers or short fibers of 
ceramics or metals, by employing a mold having a mold chamber. </p><p xml:id="_6ca63">It is known to manufacture ceramic or metallic articles from 
fine particles of the material such as powder, whiskers or short 
fibers by charging a mixture of the fine particles and a fluidal binder 
or binding agent into a mold chamber of a mold, compacting the 
mixture in the mold chamber to follow the shape of the mold chamber, 
removing the molded body out of the mold, expelling the binding agent 
out of the molded body, and sintering the fine particles to form an 
integral body. </p><p xml:id="_f9ec1">In the above article manufacturing processes, the fluidal binding 
agent has been considered to be indispensable to give a smooth fluidity 
to a mass of fine particles so that it is readily deformable to fill a 
mold chamber uniformly up to every corner thereof and also to 
maintain the shape of the molded body prior to the sintering of the fine 
particles. </p><p xml:id="_2d984">However, the process of expelling the binding agent out of the 
molded body, which is generally to heat the molded body under 
ventilation of atmosphere, takes a relatively long time, and further, if 
the heating is not carried out at an appropriate condition, there is a 
high probability that an undesirable shrinkage occurs and cracks are 
generated. </p><p xml:id="_0d45c">In order to meet with these problems, it has been proposed in 
Japanese Patent Publication 3-9064 (=US-A-4.731.208) to use a super critical fluid as 
mixed in the mixture of fine particles and a binding agent, noting that a 
super critical fluid presents a high dissolubility to the binding agent due 
to its high density, and thus it works as a good extraction agent in 
expelling the binding agent out of the molded body. </p><p xml:id="_76b14">Further, in Japanese Patent Publication 3-12122 (=US-A-5.028.363) it has been 
proposed to first replace the binding agent in the molded body by a 
super critical fluid and then to remove the super critical fluid from  
 
the molded body, while shifting the super critical state of 
the fluid directly to a gaseous state without crossing the 
liquid-gas border line, so that no state of coexistence of 
liquid and gas is encountered in the micro pores in the molded 
body, thereby avoiding that the micro structure of the molded 
body is damaged by the capillary action of the fluid in the 
micro pores. </p><p xml:id="_5f3d3">In view of the difficulties concerned with the removal of 
the binding agent from the molded body as described above, it 
is the object of the present invention to provide a method of 
forming a shaped body from fine particles such as powder, 
whiskers or short fibers of ceramics or metal, without using 
any binding agent, so that no process of removing the binding 
agent from the molded body is required. </p><p xml:id="_1fdfa">US-A-3.165.570 discloses a method without using a binding agent; 
a carrier fluid, such as air, is used to transport the particulate 
material into the mold.  
 </p><p xml:id="_abd32">The present invention provides a method of forming a 
shaped body in accordance with Claim 1. </p><p xml:id="_7f2c6">When fine particles such as powder, whiskers or short 
fibers of ceramics or metal are supplied, as mixed with a 
carrier fluid, under a pressure elevated substantially above 
atmospheric pressure, into a mold chamber of a mold through an 
inlet port thereof open to the mold chamber at a first portion 
thereof, and when the mold has an outlet port open to the mold 
chamber at a second portion thereof substantially opposite to 
said first portion and adapted to exhaust substantially only 
the carrier fluid in a gaseous state out of the mold chamber, 
a continuous flow of the carrier fluid is generated across the 
mold chamber from the inlet port to the outlet port, whereby 
a suspension of  
 
the fine particles by the carrier fluid enough to carry the fine 
particles to every corner in the mold chamber is available, and then, as 
the carrier fluid which has carried the fine particles is exhausted 
through the outlet port, the fine particles are gradually stacked up, 
starting from the location of the outlet port toward the location of the 
inlet port, forming a tight stack of the fine particles having such a 
micro structure that each fine particle is most stably received in a 
micro space afforded by several preceding fine particles and is 
subsequently pressed among those preceding fine particles by the flow 
of the carrier fluid as well as a pressure gradient across a succeeding 
stack of the fine particles. Thus, when the pressure to supply the 
mixture of the fine particles and the carrier fluid into the mold 
chamber is appropriately selected, a molded body of the fine particles 
is available in any reasonable shape to have a high integrity enough to 
maintain its shape unchanged during the succeeding sintering process. </p><p xml:id="_8d644">According to the present invention, said carrier 
fluid is at a super critical state when said mixture 
is supplied into said mold chamber, said carrier fluid being in a 
gaseous state at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. </p><p xml:id="_8acf4">However, said carrier fluid may also be at a liquid state when said 
mixture is supplied into said mold chamber, said carrier fluid being in 
a gaseous state at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. </p><p xml:id="_b037b">As viewed from another aspect of carrying out the method of the 
present invention, said mixture may be prepared to be at said elevated 
pressure in a pressure vessel equipped with a heating means and an 
agitation means, and is supplied into said mold chamber by the pressure 
in said pressure vessel. </p><p xml:id="_8489f">Alternatively, said mixture may be prepared in a vessel equipped 
with a heating means and an agitation means, and is supplied from said 
vessel into said mold chamber through a pump means which compresses 
said mixture. </p><p xml:id="_bb345">CO₂ is one of the most desirable materials to be used as said 
carrier fluid in the method according to the present invention.  
 </p><p xml:id="_23917">In the accompanying drawing, 
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatical illustration of a device to carry out an 
embodiment of the present invention; Fig. 2 is an example of a molded body of fine particles produced 
by the device shown in Fig. 1; and Fig. 3 is a view similar to Fig. 1, showing another embodiment 
of the present invention. </p><p xml:id="_384cb">In the following the present invention will be described in more 
detail with respect to some preferred embodiments with reference to 
the accompanying drawings. </p><p xml:id="_9d905">Referring to Fig. 1, 10 designates a storage container of CO₂ 
which supplies CO₂ through a conduit 12, a pump 14 and a conduit 16 
to a mixing vessel 18 having a mixing chamber 20. The CO₂ is 
selectively heated by a heater 22 while it is conducted through the 
conduit 16. The mixing vessel has a heater 24 arranged around the 
mixing chamber 20 and an agitator 28 for mixing fine particles 26 
charged in the mixing chamber 20 and the CO₂ introduced into the 
mixing chamber 20. The mixture of the fine particles and the CO₂ is 
conducted through a shutoff valve 30 and a conduit 32 to a mold 34 
through an inlet port 36. The mold 34 is made of an upper mold half 
38 and a lower mold half 40 defining in combination a mold chamber 
42. A small clearance left between the two mold halves at a location 
opposite to the inlet port 36 provides an outlet port 44 adapted to pass 
substantially only gas therethrough. </p><head xml:id="_b0b20">Example 1:</head><p xml:id="_c9f41">A molded body was made from a silicon nitride powder by 
employing the device shown in Fig. 1. </p><p xml:id="_7755c">First, a fine particle material consisting of a silicon nitride 
powder of 0.4 micron mean particle diameter forming 96 parts in 
weight, a yttrium oxide powder of 0.2 micron mean particle diameter 
forming 2 parts in weight and an alumina powder of 0.1 micron mean 
particle diameter forming 2 parts in weight was charged into the 
mixing chamber 20. </p><p xml:id="_a6a26">Then, with the shutoff valve 30 being kept closed, the mold  
 
chamber space was heated by the heater 24 up to 35°C, which is higher 
than the critical temperature 31.1°C of CO₂. Then, operating the pump 
14, opening a port valve (not shown in Fig. 1) of the storage container 
10, and operating the heater 22, CO₂ from the storage container 10 
was charged into the mixing chamber 20 until the pressure in the 
mixing chamber 20 reached 400atm, which is higher than the critical 
pressure 73.8atm of CO₂, thus rendering the CO₂ in the mixing 
chamber 20 in a super critical state. </p><p xml:id="_d3a76">The agitator 28 was also operated to mix the fine particles with 
the super critical CO₂, thus suspending the fine particles in turbulent 
flows of the CO₂. Then, opening the shutoff valve 30, the mixture 
was supplied from the mixing vessel into the mold chamber 42 through 
the inlet port 36. In the meantime, CO₂ gas was exhausted from the 
outlet port 44. When the mold chamber 42 was completely filled with 
a stack of the fine particles forming a body 46, the shutoff valve 30 
was closed, and all of the heaters 22 and 24, the pump 14 and the 
agitator 28 were stopped. </p><p xml:id="_f9ea8">Although it was unable to see the behaviour of the fine particles 
and the super critical CO₂ in the mold chamber 42, it is guessed that, 
as a part of the super critical CO₂ existing adjacent the outlet port 44 
in the mold chamber 42 is exhausted through the outlet port 44 while 
changing its state into a gas, the fine particles suspended by such part 
of the CO₂ were laid around the outlet port 44 to form a layer of 
stacked fine particles, and then, as the thickness of the stack layer 
gradually increased, it provided a flow resistance layer against the 
flowing out of the CO₂ in the mold chamber through the outlet port 44, 
thereby generating a pressure gradient across the stack layer toward 
the outlet port, successively letting each fine particle be most stably 
received in each micro space afforded by several preceding fine 
particles already formed into the stack layer, by the force generated 
according to the pressure gradient, or the flow of CO₂ and the 
compression of the stack layer exerted thereby. </p><p xml:id="_08b67">After the completion of the above molding operation, the mold 
halves were opened and the molded body 46 in the form of a 
rectangular parallelopiped block such as shown in Fig. 2 was obtained. 
The block had three dimensions precisely coinciding with those of the 
mold chamber 42. There was no shrinkage and no crack in the block.  
 </p><p xml:id="_abfa3">The density and the bending strength of the molded body 46 were 
tested. The density was substantially uniform over all portions thereof 
and was 1.50 g/cm³, presenting a volumetric density of 48%. The 
molded body was firm enough to maintain its shape for subsequent 
sintering process. It was confirmed that no CO₂ remained in the 
molded body. </p><head xml:id="_22a6a">Example 2:</head><p xml:id="_2b242">The device was modified as shown in Fig. 3 so that the pump 14 
is positioned in the conduit 32 and can supply a mixture of fine 
particles and a carrier fluid prepared in the mixing vessel 18 into the 
molding chamber 42 under a compression applied thereby. </p><p xml:id="_8c553">A mixture of 10kg silicon nitride powder of 0.5 micron mean 
particle diameter, 500g yttrium oxide of 0.1 micron mean particle 
diameter and 500g alumina powder of 0.1 micron mean particle 
diameter was charged into the mixing chamber 20 of the mixing vessel 
18. Then, with the shutoff valve 30 being kept closed, CO₂ was 
supplied into the mixing chamber 20 at 5kg/cm². Then, operating the 
heater 24, while also operating the agitator 28, the mixing chamber 
space was heated so that the temperature rised up to 80°C and the 
pressure rised up to 120kg/cm², thus rendering the CO₂ in a super 
critical state. </p><p xml:id="_5bc7e">Then, opening the shutoff valve 30, while operating the pump 14, 
the mixture of the fine particles and the super critical CO₂ was 
pumped up to 300kg/cm² and supplied to the mold chamber 20. The 
supply of the mixture under the pumping was continued, while allowing 
CO₂ gas to exhaust through the outlet port 44, until the mold chamber 
20 was completely filled with a stack of the fine particles. Then, the 
shutoff valve 30 was closed, and the pump 14 was stopped. Then, the 
mold halves were opened, and the mold body 46 was taken out. </p><p xml:id="_6836b">For the sake of comparison, several molded bodies were produced 
from the same mixture but without operating the pump 14, so that the 
pressure of supplying the mixture into the mold chamber 42 gradually 
lowered according to the consumption of the mixture in the mixture 
vessel 18. </p><p xml:id="_cd180">The difference in density of the molded body according to the 
mixture supply pressure in the mold chamber was as follows:

300kg/cm² and the molded body produced by the mixture supply 
pressure of 95kg/cm² were sintered in N2 atmosphere at 1700°C for 4 
hours. The density of the sintered bodies was measured. Further, 40 
samples for the bending test according to JIS R1601 were produced 
from each molded body, and were tested. The mean values of the 
density, the strength and the Weibull coefficient with respect to the 
samples obtained under the pressures of 300kg/cm² and 95kg/cm²

particle diameter, 500g yttrium oxide powder of 0.1 micron mean 
particle diameter and 500g alumina powder of 0.2 micron mean particle 
diameter was charged into the mixing chamber 20 of the mixing vessel 
in the device shown in Fig. 3. Then, with the shutoff valve 30 being 
kept closed, CO₂ under pressure was charged into the mixing chamber 
20. The pressure and the temperature in the mixing chamber space 
were adjusted to be 100kg/cm² and 23°C, respectively, so that the CO2 
was in a liquid state. The amount of CO2 charged in the mixing 
chamber 20 was 3.5kg. </p><p xml:id="_dcd63">After full agitation of the mixture by the agitator 28, opening the 
shutoff valve 30, while operating the pump 14, the mixture was pumped 
up to 200kg/cm² and supplied into the mold chamber 42. The pumping  
 
supply of the mixture into the mold chamber was continued, 
while CO₂ gas was exhausted through the outlet port 44, until 
the mold chamber 42 was completely filled with a stack of the 
fine particles. Then, the shutoff valve was closed, the pump 
14 was stopped, and the molded body was taken out from the 
mold in the same rectangular parallelopiped block form. </p><p xml:id="_a8ebc">The molded body showed three dimensions precisely 
coinciding with those of the mold chamber 42. The density was 
1.37g/cm³. No CO₂ remained in the molded body. </p><p xml:id="_5080f">The molded body was sintered in N₂ atmosphere at 1750°C 
for 4 hours. 40 samples for the bending test according to 
JIS R1601 were produced from the sintered body, and tested. 
The mean values of the strength and the Weibull coefficient 
were 1210 MPa and 14, respectively.  
 </p><p xml:id="_b06dc">From the foregoing it will be appreciated that according 
to the present invention molded bodies of fine particles such 
as powder, whiskers or short fibers of ceramics or metal to be 
turned into integral ceramic or metallic articles by a 
subsequent sintering process are obtained to have a shape and 
dimensions defined by a mold chamber at high fidelity, with no 
use of binding agent, thereby obviating the difficulties 
concerned with expelling the binding agent from the molded 
bodies. Therefore, a high productivity is available in the 
manufacture of shaped articles of ceramics or metal starting 
from fine particles of the material. </p></div></body></text></group></text></TEI></teiCorpus></teiCorpus>
