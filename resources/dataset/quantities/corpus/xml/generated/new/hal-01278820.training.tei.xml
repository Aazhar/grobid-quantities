Here we show how massive planets like these can affect the human consciousnesses, when they approach the Sun, and pass nearby the Earth.</p>
		<p>The existence of other planets, orbiting our Sun beyond Pluto, has been frequently proposed by several astronomers. Usually they result from the search for explanations for anomalies in the orbits of objects near the Kuiper Belt.</p>
		<p>In 2014, Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo wrote an article [1] on small objects with strange discrepancies in their orbits, which can have been caused by several factors. However, the most likely cause would be a new unknown planet. Now, scientists at Caltech (Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown) seem to have found evidences of a giant planet orbiting our sun, in an orbit whose period would last approximately of <measure type="value"><num>15 thousand</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="years">years</measure></measure>. The article published by Batygin and Brown in the The Astronomical Journal [2], describes this new planet as being <measure type="value"><num>five</num></measure> to <measure type="value"><num>ten</num></measure> times more massive than the Earth, and having a diameter of <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> to four times the diameter of the Earth. The orbit of the new planet is gigantic, never coming closer to the Sun than <measure type="value"><num>30.5 billion</num> <measure type="LENGTH" unit="kilometers">kilometers</measure></measure>.</p>
		<p>The discovery of planets whose orbits go beyond Pluto is not new, because we know of the existence of Sedna, Haumea and Makemake (dwarf planets), and also Eris, which is more massive than Pluto. But all these planets have much less mass than the giant planet that was recently predicted by Batygin and Brown. In this article we show how massive planets like these can affect the human consciousnesses, when they approach the Sun, and pass close to Earth.</p>
		<p>In a previous article we have shown that the mass of a material particle is composed by a real part and an imaginary part, both related to the gravitational mass of the particle [3], i.e., is coefficient related to the particle. The first term is therefore the real gravitational mass of the particle while the second is the imaginary gravitational mass of the particle. k It was shown that an imaginary body (containing imaginary mass only) is equivalent to a consciousness, in such way that imaginary particles would be equivalents to psychic particles and, therefore their masses (imaginary and psychic) would be equivalents. This lead to the conclusion that material particles have a psychic mass associated to its real mass. In a general way, it would be something similar to electric charges associated to material particles. Thus, similarly that the electric charges interact each other through electrical interaction, and the gravitational masses by means of gravitational interaction, also psychic masses interact each other through a specific interaction, which we call psychic interaction.</p>
		<p>We have shown that the psychic interaction between <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> psychics masses and generates a force, , whose expression is similar to the expression of the force between <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> gravitational masses(Newton's law)[ Therefore, the psychic force that the individual psychic mass of the planet X, , exerts on one X m ψ † Superficial electric charge. ‡ It was shown in a previous paper [7] that the cultivation of good-quality thoughts is highly beneficial to a person because increase the psychic mass of its consciousness. On the contrary, the cultivation of bad-quality thoughts makes human consciousness lose psychic mass. Thus, the psychic masses of the human consciousnesses can be positive or negative (by the frequent loss of psychic mass).</p>
		<p>human consciousnesses with positive psychic mass, is given by</p>
		<p>where μ ˆ is a versor oriented from the planet X to Earth.</p>
		<p>The psychic force that the individual psychic mass of the planet X, , exerts on one X m ψ human consciousnesses with negative psychic mass, is given by</p>
		<p>The resultants upon the human consciousnesses with positive psychic mass , and upon the human consciousnesses with negative psychic mass , are respectively, given by (See Fig.1)</p>
		<p>, (Eqs. (18) and (14)).</p>
		<p>When this occurs, the link between the human consciousnesses with negative psychic masses and the human bodies, in which they are incorporated into, will be broken §. After, the mentioned consciousnesses will be sucked to the planet X, by means of the action of the force</p>
		<p>Similarly, the human consciousnesses with negative psychic masses, which are not incorporated into human bodies on Earth, also they will be sucked to the planet X (See Fig.1).</p>
		<p>The removal of the consciousnesses with negative psychic masses means that all the evil will be removed from Earth because they are basically the cause of the evil on Earth. Under these new conditions, the consciousnesses with positive psychic masses, which will remain on Earth will live in peace, evolving with their good-quality thoughts. Stated thus, "the good shall inherit the earth".</p>
		<p>Finally</p>
		<p>Therefore, we conclude that the Earth's trajectory around the Sun will not be significatively disturbed by the psychic interaction between the planet X and Earth.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, note that if § Obviously, this will cause the death of the person. From this equation, we have derived the Eqs. (6) and (7). Equation (6) tells us that, if the electric charge associated to a psychic mass is negative, then the psychic mass is positive, and vice-versa. Equation (7) tells us that, if the electric charge associated to a psychic mass is positive, then the psychic mass is negative, and vice-versa.</p>
		<p>The Human Consciousnesses are obviously, connected to the human bodies (more exactly connected to their Material Individual Consciousnesses ** ), which they are incorporated. This connection should be similar to an electrical umbilical cord, in order to transfer to the human bodies the commands sent by the Human Consciousnesses incorporated to the human bodies. Then, electric charges would be transferred from the Human Consciousnesses to the Material Individual Consciousnesses of the bodies, and vice-versa.</p>
		<p>The transfer of negative electric charges from a Human Consciousness to a Material Individual Consciousnesses of a human body, would occur, for example, during the increasing of negative psychic mass of a consciousness, according to Eq. (7). Similarly, the transfer of negative electric charges from the Material Individual Consciousnesses of human bodies to the Human Consciousnesses, which they are incorporated, it would occur during the decreasing of negative psychic mass of the consciousnesses. Obviously that there would have an electrostatic equilibrium between the Human Consciousness and the Material Individual Consciousness of the human body, in such way that the electric charge in the human consciousness,</p>
		<p>, and the electric charge , exerted by the planet X in the consciousnesses over the Earth, will be about <measure type="value"><num>10</num></measure> times higher than maximum psychic force, , which is possible to exert on a consciousness, Note that in spite of the intensity of the force cE R , the maximum acceleration that it will produce upon the consciousnesses over the Earth will be very smaller than the local gravity acceleration, g r , (see Eq. (19)).</p>
		<p>While the psychic force cE R − r sucks from the Earth the consciousnesses with negative psychic mass, simultaneously the psychic force cE R + r compresses against Earth the Human Consciousnesses with positive psychic mass (See Fig.3). However, these consciousnesses do not leave the bodies which are incorporated (See Fig.3 (b)) because they can not penetrate in the Earth's consciousness [9]). Now, we will show that, when Human consciousnesses leave abruptly the human bodies they (the Human bodies) can become imaginary bodies (psychic bodies), and consequently they disappears from the real Universe. Delta waves are the slowest recorded brain waves in human beings. They were recently defined as having a frequency between 0.01-4 Hz [10]. Spontaneous slow fluctuations (<measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.1">0.1</num>-<num atMost="1">1</num> <measure type="FREQUENCY" unit="Hz">Hz</measure></measure>) and infra-slow fluctuations (<measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.01">0.01</num>-<num atMost="0.1">0.1</num> <measure type="FREQUENCY" unit="Hz">Hz</measure></measure>) are ubiquitous in brain dynamics. In electrophysiological recordings, these fluctuations have been observed both in single-unit and multiunit firing rates [, , <measure type="list"><num>11</num><num>12</num><num>13</num></measure>, 14, and 15]. Assuming that the lower frequencies of delta radiation correspond to the lower frequencies of radiation that a human body can emit, and that, based on the experimental observations, these frequencies should be of the order of <measure type="value"><num>0.001</num><measure type="FREQUENCY" unit="Hz">Hz</measure></measure>, then we can infer that the spectrum ‡ ‡ The liberation of this postmortem energy is a phenomenon known for centuries. When the consciousness of a human being is removed abruptly, as previously mentioned (for example in the case of planet X), the energy should be radiated in a very short time interval. This situation is similar to the case, when by collision with another particle or atom the valence electron is raised to an excited state, and it remains there for a period (mean life) before jumping down to a lower level with emission of a photon. ( ) , which is the critical range in which the particles become imaginaries, i.e., they make a transition to the imaginary spacetime [3]. Consequently, we can conclude that, in the above condition (Eq. (43)</p>
