Due to the electrical property (e.g., conductivity and/or permittivity) mismatch between the solid and liquid phases, <measure type="value"><num>one</num></measure> can control the apparent macroscopic properties of the ER fluid such as the effective viscosity for suspensions via the application of external direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) electric fields. Literature has therefore categorized ER effects, based on the flow or rheological responses, into either positive ER or negative ER phenomena when the fluid suspension is subjected to electric fields [1][2][3][4][5][6].</p><p>Upon the application of DC electric fields, Foulc et al. [4] discussed the important role of electrical conductivities of the respective solid and liquid phases in determining the inter-particle electrical force interactions in ER fluids. Boissy et al. [5] then further characterized and made distinctions of macroscopic positive and negative ER responses based on different relative magnitudes of the respective conductivities of the <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> phases. For ER fluids consisting of microparticles with a conductivity, 2  , larger than that, 1  , of the carrier liquid, stable particle chains are formed in the direction of the electric field so that the macroscopic fluid resistance against externally applied shear perpendicular to the electric field is enhanced and result in an increased measured effective viscosity-the positive ER effect [1][2][3]. On the other hand, when the conductivity of the carrier liquid is larger than that of the micro-particles, i.e., <measure type="list"><num>12</num></measure>   , laminated layers (perpendicular to the electric field) of packed particles resulting from electromigration are formed adjacent to one of the <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> electrodes leaving a portion of the ER fluid relatively clear of particles and hence leading to a reduction in the resistance against externally applied shear forces perpendicular to the electric field; a decrease in the effective viscosity is measured-the negative ER effect [5,6].</p><p>Despite the relatively sparse reports on negative ER effects, recent experimental observations found that: (i) with a given constant shear rate or equivalently the Couette boundary driving velocity, the measured shear stress required to drive the Couette ER fluid flow is reduced (an effectively decreased viscosity) and (ii) at a given constant pressure gradient, the Poiseuille flow rate of the ER fluid can be increased both by applying a uniform DC electric field perpendicular to the direction of the flows [7][8][9][10][11][12]. The mechanism responsible for the apparent increased flow 3 dielectric micro-particles suspended within the carrier liquid, which is a mechanism different from the traditional electromigration or particle electrophoresis explanation as mentioned in previous negative ER literature [5,6]. This spontaneous particle rotation under the action of a DC electric field is often called "Quincke rotation" for G. Quincke"s systematic study done in 1896 [13][14][15][16][17][18]. electric field is applied across the dilute suspension, charge relaxation follows the MaxwellWagner polarization at the solid-liquid interfaces, and each of the suspended particles attains a final equilibrium dipole moment in the opposite direction to that of the applied DC field for the condition of <measure type="value"><num>21</num></measure>  . This, however, is an unstable equilibrium, and as the applied electric field reaches a critical value [17,18], namely,</p><p>where 0  is the viscosity of the carrier liquid, the liquid viscous dampening can no longer withstand any small perturbations misaligning the particle dipole moment and the applied DC field. The electrical torque resulting from the misalignment exceeds the viscous torque exerted on the micro-particle giving rise to spontaneous, self-sustained particle rotation either clockwise or counter clockwise with the rotation axis perpendicular to the planes defined by the electric field. When the particle-liquid suspension, or ER fluid, is driven by a boundary shear stress (Couette flow) or a pressure gradient (Poiseuille flow), the macroscopic flow vorticity gives the suspended micro-particles, instead of by random chance, preferable directions for rotation via viscous interactions once the external electric field (generally larger than the critical field, c E ) is applied. It is this combined effect of microscopic electrorotation and macroscopic flow vorticity that gives rise to the newly observed negative ER phenomenon as described above [7][8][9][10][11][12].</p><p>Although models are given in current literature for analyzing the new phenomenon, they are focused on the dynamics of a single particle and the utilization of a two-phase volume averaged, 5 the spin viscosity should be identically zero. However, spin-up velocity profiles measured by ultrasound velocimetry reported by He [23], Elborai [24], and Chaves et al. [26,27] were compared with the numerical simulations of the full spin-up flow governing equations and found that the experimental and numerical results would agree only if the spin viscosity assumes some finite value instead of being vanishingly small or identically zero.</p><p>Acknowledging the experimental and theoretical discrepancies in the value of spin viscosity and identifying the "mathematically analogous, physically parallel mechanisms" governing the respective electrorotation and ferrofluid spin-up flows as summarized in Table 1, this work is therefore aimed at developing a classical continuum mechanical model that combines particle electrorotation and anti-symmetric/couple stress theories for describing the electrorheological behavior of a particle-liquid mixture (termed ER fluid henceforward) subjected to a DC electric field strength higher than the Quincke rotation threshold in both Couette and Poiseuille flow geometries. Using a set of continuum modeling field equations similar to that utilized in ferrofluid spin-up flow analyses, we investigate the effects of a zero spin viscosity, '0   , i.e., zero diffusive transport of angular momentum or couple stress free conditions, on the angular momentum balances in the present negative ER fluid flow of interest. In the next section, the governing equations describing the mass conservation, linear momentum conservation, angular momentum conservation, and polarization relaxation of the ER fluid flow will be given in their most general forms. The specific governing equations, analytical expressions of the spin velocity solutions, and the evaluated numerical results are then presented, compared, and discussed in Sections 3 and 4 to respectively show how the pertinent physical parameters are related to the ER responses and fluid flow for <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> dimensional (2D) Couette and Poiseuille flows with internal micro-particle electrorotation. A conclusion is given at the end of this article to summarize the principle findings and the motivations for future research.</p><p>In order to quantitatively model and describe the present ER flow phenomenon, several physical principles involved are considered: (i) the continuity or mass conservation, (ii) the linear momentum balance, (iii) the angular momentum balance, and (iv) the polarization relaxation of <measure type="value"><num>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 6 the</num></measure> ER fluid flow. The governing equations are given in the following subsections to describe the above physical principles in proper mathematical forms.</p><p>The continuum equations describing the ER fluid motion are the mass continuity equation for</p><p>the linear momentum equation,</p><p>and the angular momentum equation,</p><p>where v is the linear flow velocity,  is the ER fluid density, p is the hydrodynamic pressure in the flow field, t P is the fluid total polarization, E is the electric field,  is the flow spin velocity, I is the average moment of inertia per unit volume, '  is the spin viscosity,  is the vortex viscosity which is related to the carrier liquid viscosity, 0</p><p>Note that Eq. (3) generally follows the form of the well known Navier-Stokes equation.</p><p>However, by introducing micro-particle rotation to the fluid flow, additional terms are included in Eq. (3) to account for the Kelvin body force density,   t PE  , and the anti-symmetric force density, 2  , as contributions in the linear momentum balances of the fluid flow. Moreover , <measure type="value"><num>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 7</num> <measure type="?" unit="momentum">momentum</measure></measure> balances resulting from the electrical torque input and fluid motion can be described and related to other variables pertinent to this problem. In Eq. (4), the left hand side represents the angular momentum per unit volume of a continuum ER fluid parcel; the first term on the right hand side (RHS) represents the electrical torque density introduced to the flow field via the rotating micro-particles under the action of the external DC field; the second term on the RHS represents the angular momentum density transformation or conversion between the vorticity and the spin velocity fields; the third term on the RHS represents the gradient of the divergence of the spin velocity and is analogous to the "gradient of the divergence of the velocity" term in Eq.</p><p>(3) that measures the bulk compression effects in the fluid flow; and finally, the last term on the RHS represents the diffusive transport of angular momentum within the flow field [22].</p><p>The electric field in the ER flow field is generally described by the electro-quasi-static (EQS)</p><p>Maxwell equations [16,34], namely, 0 E   , and</p><p>where D is the electric displacement field and f  is the free space charge density. Here, we have assumed that on the macroscopic continuum level, the free space charge density is <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure>.</p><p>To complete the description of the electrical subsystem, we need a continuum phenomenological polarization relaxation equation that accounts for the non-equilibrium effects of both the linear and angular motions on the ER fluid polarization. Since the torque input on the micro scale is related to the induced surface charge around the surface of the micro-particles, we shall focus on how non-equilibrium motion, i.e., micro-particle rotation,  , continuum fluid spin velocity,  , and continuum fluid velocity, v , affects the retarding polarization, P (the part of polarization directly related to the surface charges [7][8][9][10][11][12]), instead of the total polarization of the ER fluid, t P. Note that by definition, the spin velocity,  , and the linear velocity, v , are continuum variables which are related to respective averages of the internal angular momentum and linear momentum over collections of micro-particles and carrier liquid molecules in an ER fluid parcel. They should be distinguished from the micro-particle rotation velocity,  , which is <measure type="value"><num>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 8</num></measure></p><p>We start the development of the polarization relaxation equation and its equilibrium polarization from the micro scale. The governing equation for the <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> region problem of the EQS fields within ( rR  ) and outside ( rR  ) a spherical solid particle suspended in a liquid medium rotating at a constant speed, x i    , subjected to a uniform electric field, † † <measure type="value"><num>0</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure> z z E E i E i  ( † denotes microscopic field quantities), as shown in Fig. 1</p><p>where R is the radius of the micro-particle and †  is the electric potential, i.e., † † E  . The boundary conditions on Eq. (8) are the electric field strength far away from the micro-particle,</p><p>the continuity of the electric potential at the solid-liquid interface,</p><p>and charge conservation at the rotating micro-particle surface, (9), the electric potentials and electric fields within and outside the rotating micro-particle can be solved by the method of separation of variables with the aid of associated Legendre polynomials. This problem has been solved by Cebers [35];</p><p>here, we only summarize the solutions to the electric potential and the effective dipole moment of the particle for rR . The outer electric potential ( rR  ) is given in spherical coordinates as</p><p>sin cos sin sin cos  , on the particle in steady state, we can find the critical electric field for Quincke rotation as given in Eq. (1) and the rotation velocity of the micro-particle being [18]</p><p>where the + and-signs denote counter clockwise and clockwise rotation with the coordinate system defined in Fig. 1. In Eq. (17), we have assumed that the particle rotation is only in the xdirection; this is because we will only be considering 2D flow geometries in the following discussions. Note however that for the most general cases, the particle rotation axis is perpendicular to the planes defined by the electric field, which has a <measure type="value"><num>three</num></measure> dimensional feature.</p><p>We next consider a dilute particle suspension with a solid volume fraction of  and a particle number density of n subjected to the DC electric field. The solid volume fraction and the particle number density are related through</p><p>where 2 dR  is the diameter of the micro-particle. Assuming that the mutual electrical interactions between the suspended micro-particles can be neglected (i.e., dilute suspension with 1  ), the macroscopic retarding polarization of the ER fluid at equilibrium, eq P , can be obtained by multiplying Eq. (16) with the particle number density, n , i.e., EE  ,  is set to zero in Eq. (19) since an applied field less than the critical field will give imaginary values of  and the real root can only be zero as in Eq. (17). Note that by setting the micro-particle rotation speed  to zero, the equilibrium retarding polarization shown in Eq. (19) reduces back to the <measure type="value"><num>one</num></measure> given by Cebers [35], i.e., all micro-particle rotation speed, continuum linear velocity, and continuum spin velocity equal to zero. Combining Eqs. (17) and (19) and extending the physical arguments of the phenomenological magnetization relaxation equation proposed by Shliomis [22,37,38] to the case of the retarding polarization, we arrive at the following retarding polarization relaxation equation,</p><p>where P is the retarding polarization.</p><p>Equations (17), (19), and (20) account for the non-equilibrium effects of the micro-particle rotation velocity,  , ER fluid spin velocity,  , and ER fluid linear velocity, v , on the retarding polarization. In the development of Eqs. (17), (19), and (20), we have assumed that the induced dipole moment on the micro-particles obeys the Maxwell-Wagner polarization-the induced charges are distributed on the surface of the particles at the micro scale. We have also assumed that only the retarding part of the macroscopic ER fluid polarization, i.e., the polarization directly related to the interfacial charges, needs to be relaxed according to the non-equilibrium motions.</p><p>Unlike the ferrofluid equilibrium magnetization, the equilibrium retarding polarization, Eq. (19), does not follow a Langevin function [22]. This is because we are considering the rotation of micro-sized dielectric insulating particles on which Brownian motion has little influence [18].</p><p>Rigorously speaking, the micro-particle rotation speed,  , that enters Eqs. (19) and (20) should be the speed observed in the reference frame that rotates with the ER fluid parcel. Yet, the mathematical analysis of this ER fluid flow will become much more involved and impractical in attempts to correct for the difference in reference frames, and is beyond the scope of this work.</p><p>As a first approach, we employ Eq. (17) in Eqs. (19) and (20) to incorporate both microscopic (i.e.,  ) and macroscopic (i.e.,  and v ) motions under one continuum mechanical framework. 3. Couette Flow with Internal Micro-particle Electrorotation</p><p>Consider the Couette flow geometry shown in the schematic diagram of Fig. 2. The lower plate of the parallel plate system is fixed at <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> velocity while the upper plate is applied with a constant velocity, <measure type="value"><num>0</num> <measure type="?" unit="U">U</measure></measure> , in the positive y-direction. We assume that the flow is steady ( Therefore, the applied DC electric field is to be in the z-direction only. The fringing effects at the ends of the channel are to be neglected.</p><p>The governing equations are further simplified by considering a zero spin viscosity, i.e., have substituted the total polarization, ty P , with the retarding polarization, y P , in Eq. (23). This is because the DC electric field is applied in the z-direction only with <measure type="value"><num>0</num> <measure type="?" unit="y">y</measure></measure> E . Thus the total polarization in the y-direction comes from the dipole moment tilt of the rotating micro-particles in the micro scale, which, on the macroscopic level, is generally the y-component of the retarding polarization. Finally, the z-linear momentum equation reduces to an equation which relates only the pressure gradient to the Kelvin body force density, and thus can be treated separately from the other equations.</p><p>Substituting Eq. (19) into Eq. (21), we can solve for the y-and z-components of the retarding polarization as</p><p>with  given in Eq. (17). Generally speaking, the z-component of the electric field, z E , in Eq.</p><p>(23) depends on the flow linear and spin velocities, and the EQS equations, Eqs. (6) and (7), need to be solved together with the retarding polarization, Eqs. (24) and (25), linear momentum, Eq. (22), and angular momentum, Eq. (23), equations with the suitable electrical and mechanical boundary conditions applied at <measure type="value"><num>0</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure>  and h. However, the coupled set of governing equations becomes much more non-linear and less practical for engineering analysis purposes. Assuming that, due to flow motion, corrections to the z-electric field, z E , can be related to the microscopic</p><p>where i e "s are the correction terms, we substitute Eq. (24a) into Eq. (23) and approximate to the first order of magnitude of the volume fraction,  ,</p><p>, so that the electrical field equations, Eqs. (6) and (7), can be decoupled from the mechanical field equations, Eqs. (2) (4), or Eqs. (22) and (23). Hence the governing equations specific to the Couette flow geometry with internal particle electrorotation is obtained as Eq. (22) and</p><p>where * (27), the first order correction, 1 e , to the z-electric field has been neglected because 1 e has become a second order term after being substituted into Eq. (23),</p><p>The boundary condition for the velocity field,</p><p>On the other hand, the angular momentum equation, Eq. (27), eventually reduces to an algebraic equation for <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> spin viscosity conditions as will be discussed shortly in Section 3.2; hence, there are no additional constraints to be applied at the boundaries for the Couette spin velocity field. This "free-to-spin" condition on x  for '0   is likely an analogous case to the Euler equation for inviscid fluid flow-the linear flow velocity is allowed to slip at the solid-fluid boundaries when the fluid viscosity goes to zero.</p><p>Integrating Eq. (22)</p><p>and the solution to Eq. (29) is</p><p>Inserting Eq. (30) into Eq. (27) and using the following non-dimensionalization scheme, namely,</p><p>the non-dimensional angular momentum equation is obtained as</p><p>Equation (32) can be solved to obtain analytical expressions by symbolic calculation packages (Mathematica, Wolfram Research, Inc.) and the <measure type="value"><num>three</num></measure> roots of Eq. (32) are expressed as functions of *  and * M. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that not all the <measure type="value"><num>three</num></measure> roots to *  are likely to be physically meaningful and interpretable for the flow phenomena of interest presented herein. Moreover, each of the <measure type="value"><num>three</num></measure> roots may vary from real to complex valued (or vice versa) in different parametric regimes. In order to find the most physically meaningful and interpretable solution or combination of solutions from the <measure type="value"><num>three</num></measure> possible roots to the current problem, the following considerations and conditions are applied to the flow field: (i) only real valued solutions are considered, (ii) the ER fluid is "free-to-spin" at the solid-ER fluid boundaries since the governing physics reduce from a boundary value problem to an algebraic problem in <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> spin viscosity conditions, and (iii) due to micro scale viscous interactions, the micro-particle angular velocity,  , should rotate in the same direction as that of the macroscopic ER flow vorticity so that the micro-particle rotation is always stable [7][8][9][10][11][12].</p><p>We have shown that the spin velocity is a constant throughout the channel when '0   in the Couette geometry. Hence, *  assumes some finite value at the solid-ER fluid boundaries, which is readily self-consistent with the "free-to-spin" condition. To satisfy condition (iii) for 0</p><p>we need to substitute into Eqs. (24) and (25) (17)) in Eqs. (24) and (25) (17), (24), and (25)</p><p>in which denotes the shear stress differences across the solid-liquid interface, z i is the row</p><p>is the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> field ER fluid (particle-liquid mixture) viscosity as defined in Section 2.1. The shear stress difference in Eq. (37a) is evaluated at <measure type="value"><num>0</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure>  .</p><p>After obtaining the velocity and spin velocity fields as well as the effective viscosity, we now further present the numerical evaluations of the analytical expressions given in Eqs. (33), (34), and (38). The system parameters, physical constants, and material properties used in our 18 evaluations follow those given in Ref. [7][8][9][10][11][12] so as to facilitate a more effective comparison between the current continuum model and the <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure>-phase effective continuum formulation found in the literature. These data are summarized in Table 2.</p><p>Shown in Fig. 3</p><p>, or half of the Couette flow vorticity, which can be readily deduced from Eq. (32) by letting * M  or <measure type="value"><num>0 0</num> <measure type="?" unit="E">E</measure></measure> . This solution is noted by the top most, gray line with * 0 E  in Fig. 3.</p><p>Notice that for a given field strength and shear rate, the spin velocity, *  or x  , is a constant throughout the channel and, thus, does not depend on the spatial z-coordinate as already discussed in Section 3.2 for the Couette geometry. With the spin velocity being a constant in Eq.</p><p>(22), the velocity field of Couette flow with internal micro-particle electrorotation is found to be the same as that of Couette flow without particles-a result consistent with those given in Shliomis [39] and Rosensweig [22]. Thus, the velocity field of Couette flow with micro-particle electrorotation in the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> spin viscosity limit is simply the linear profile given by Eq. (30). 19 seen that the effective viscosity decreases as the applied DC electric field strength increases.</p><p>However, as the magnitude of the shear rate increases, the amount of reduction in the effective viscosity decreases regardless of the applied electric field strength. Since the effective viscosity is normalized and non-dimensionalized by the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> electric field ER fluid viscosity,  , we further point out that the value of *  should approach one as the applied electric field goes to zero, which is a result easily found by substituting ** <measure type="value"><num>0 2</num> <measure type="?" unit=""></measure></measure>  into Eq. (38). The <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> electric field result is indicated by the gray line in Fig. 4. It can be seen from the figure that the predicted effective viscosities *  approach to one when the shear rate, *  , goes large or when the applied electric field strength is reduced.</p><p>From Fig. 4, we find that zero or negative viscosities are attainable when the applied DC electric field strength is strong enough. By using the terms "zero or negative viscosities," we do not mean that the true fluid viscosity is zero or negative, but that the effective or apparent viscosity comes out to be zero or a negative value through performing the force balance described by Eqs. (37) and (38) when the boundary shear stress, s  , is maintained a constant. In experimental terms, as the applied electric field strength becomes large, the "pumping" or "conveyer belt" effect of the micro-particles undergoing electrorotation on the ER fluid continuum becomes so significant that the ER fluid spin or rotation itself, instead of some externally applied force or torque, provides the shear stress required to move the upper plate of the Couette geometry. Therefore, we may observe a finite shear rate, *  , or plate velocity, <measure type="value"><num>0</num> <measure type="?" unit="U">U</measure></measure> , while the readings on the rheometer or viscometer indicate a zero torque applied to the fluid. As for negative effective viscosity conditions, the electrorotation conveyer belt is so effective that the rheometer or viscometer needs to "hold back" the Couette driving plate to maintain some value of applied torque or shear rate. Further discussions can be found in Lobry and Lemaire [7] for the rheometric experimental considerations and in Rinaldi et al. [40] for experimental torque measurements on ferrofluids subjected to rotating magnetic fields.</p><p>The effective viscosity solutions given by the present continuum model can be compared with the theoretical and experimental results found in Lemaire et al. [12] by using the same carrier liquid conductivity, ( Sm), and other material parameters in the numerical evaluations of the present continuum model. Using their material properties and parameters, the</p><p>where p C is a constant. Equation (40) is then substituted into Eq. (27) so that the angular momentum equation becomes</p><p>which is an algebraic, cubic equation with the z-coordinate being a spatially varying coefficient.</p><p>Using the following non-dimensionalization scheme, namely,</p><p>We solve Eq. (44)</p><p>(ii) at * <measure type="value"><num>0.5</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure>  ,</p><p>and (iii) in</p><p>(using negative valued  of Eq. (17) in Eqs. (24) and (25)</p><p>As for electric field strengths below the critical electric field, i.e., 0 c EE  , the micro-particle rotation speed,  , is set to zero in Eqs. (24) and (25) (24) and (25) during the evaluation of the spin velocity profile. The analytic expressions given above are obtained under the "Solve" command using Mathematica.</p><p>Again notice that the solution or combination of solutions given to Eq. (44) need to satisfy all the above conditions and reasoning within the parametric regimes of interest since it is less likely to be physical for solutions being complex or multi-valued. 25 regimes of particular interests, the combination of solutions and the parametric range where the solutions becomes multi-valued may be different from the ones discussed herein. In this case, we need to start from Eq. (44) and solve for the <measure type="value"><num>three</num></measure> roots, then simultaneously apply the stability, symmetry, real valued, and "free-to-spin" conditions to the roots to finally pick out or select the suitable and most physical combination for the desired spin velocity field just like the procedure we have shown in this section. Also notice that the jump or discontinuity made in the final spin velocity profile at * <measure type="value"><num>0.5</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure>  is permitted self-consistently by the "free-to-spin" condition for the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> spin viscosity cases studied herein. This is an analogous situation to the "inviscid" parallel shear flow with the velocity field being y</p><p>where * z is the dummy index and Eqs. (45) and (47) , can be respectively compared.</p><p>Results of the spin velocity profile, (linear) velocity profile, and the volume flow rate will be respectively presented in the following subsection. The system parameters, physical constants, and material properties used in the numeric evaluations can be found in Table 2 unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Before presenting the spin velocity profiles, we first normalize the Poiseuille spin velocity, Eqs. (45) show that we have chosen, based on the macroscopic Poiseuille vorticity directions, the combination of solutions that satisfies the symmetry, real valued, and stable particle rotation conditions. The apparent jump or discontinuity in the spin velocity profile at * <measure type="value"><num>0.5</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure>  is self-consistently permitted by the "free-to-spin" condition under the framework of the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> spin viscosity limit as already mentioned in the previous sections.</p><p>As can be seen in Fig. 8, the magnitude of the normalized spin velocity of Poiseuille flow with internal particle electrorotation increases as the applied DC electric field strength is increased. If, on the contrary, we reduce the applied electric field strength from * E  <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="1.0, 0.8">1.0, 0.8</num> to <num atMost="0.4">0.4</num></measure>, we find that the spin velocity gradually approaches the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> electric field solution noted by the gray curve in Fig. 8. Moreover, the strength of the jump or discontinuity at * <measure type="value"><num>0. 1</num></measure> u z z  , i.e., the velocity field of ordinary Poiseuille flow without internal micro-particle electrorotation. Recall that the velocity field was already normalized by <measure type="value"><num>2 2</num></measure></p><p>h   in the non-dimensional definition of Eq. (50); hence, there is no more need to define a normalized velocity field as in the case of the spin velocity.</p><p>Based upon the above convention, we find in Fig. 9 that with * 1  kept constant, the flow velocity is considerably enhanced and the cusp in the velocity profile at * <measure type="value"><num>0.5</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure>  is sharpened as the strength of the applied DC electric field is increased. If we reduce the strength of the electric field while the pressure gradient is maintained constant, the cusp at * <measure type="value"><num>0.5</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure>  becomes blunt and the electrorotation enhanced velocity profile gradually reduces and converges back to the * 0 E  solution, i.e., the parabolic Poiseuille flow velocity field without internal particle electrorotation as noted by the solid gray curve in the figure Finally, using the physical parameters and material properties given in Table 2 From Fig. 10, we find that the volume flow rate increases as the applied DC electric field strength is increased while the driving pressure gradient is kept constant. On the other hand, the electrorotation enhanced volume flow rate gradually reduces back to the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> electric field solution, 30 observations reported in Ref. [10]. Note that the flow rate solutions evaluated at * E  , <measure type="list"><num>1.0</num><num>2.0</num></measure>, and 3.0 suggest non-zero volume flow rates at <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> driving pressure gradients when the flow is subjected to an applied electric field strength greater than or equal to the critical electric field for the onset of Quincke rotation. This result is particularly due to the fact that we have used the combination of solutions to the spin velocity, Eqs. (45) (47), that satisfies the symmetry, real valued, stable micro-particle rotation, and free-to-spin conditions in the modeling and evaluation of the volume flow rate, Q , under zero spin viscosity conditions, i.e., '0  . Nonetheless, we need to point out that unless there is some initial flow ( * <measure type="value"><num>0</num> <measure type="?" unit=""></measure></measure> ) applied to give the suspended micro-particles a favorable direction for electrorotation, the direction for Quincke rotation is merely a matter of chance with the particle rotation axis either pointing into or out of the planes defined by the electric field under zero flow or equivalently zero driving pressure gradient conditions. Up to this point, no experimental evidence has observed a negative ER effect with <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> initial flow when an electric field strength, <measure type="value"><num>0</num> <measure type="VOLUME" unit="c">c</measure></measure> EE  , is applied [7]both initial vorticity and micro-particle Quincke rotation are needed for the present negative ER effect. The finite jump of volume flow rate at <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> driving pressure gradients diminishes and eventually becomes zero, i.e.,</p><p>zero flow rate at <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> pressure gradient, as we reduce the applied electric field strength from Summing up the findings from examining Figs. 8-10, it is found that, in general, the magnitude of the normalized spin velocity, the normalized flow velocity, and the 2D volume flow rate is increased as the applied electric field, * E , is increased with the driving pressure gradient, *  , kept constant. Moreover, increasing the applied electric field gives rise to a more severe jump or discontinuity at * <measure type="value"><num>0.5</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure>  in the normalized spin velocity profile, sharpens the cusp structure at * <measure type="value"><num>0.5</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure>  in the (normalized) velocity profile, and results in a finite value of volume flow rate at <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> pressure gradients. Contrarily, reducing the strength of the electric field smoothes out the cusp in the velocity profile and reduces the severity of the discontinuity at * <measure type="value"><num>0.5</num> <measure type="?" unit="z">z</measure></measure>  in the spin velocity field while the pressure gradient is kept constant. The (normalized)</p><p>velocity and spin velocity profiles as well as the 2D volume flow rate gradually reduce back to the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> electric field solutions as the applied electric field strength is reduced.</p><p>Lastly, as shown in Fig. 11, the theoretical predictions of the 2D Poiseuille volume flow rate from the present continuum mechanical model are compared with the experimental data found from Figs. 5 and 6 of Lemaire et al. [10] by using the same material and physical parameters, e.g., channel height of <measure type="value"><num>750</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="h">h</measure></measure>  ( m  ) and electric field strengths of <measure type="value"><num>0 2.7</num> <measure type="?" unit="E">E</measure></measure>  and 3.3 ( <measure type="value"><num>kV</num> <measure type="LENGTH" unit="mm">mm</measure></measure> ), employed therein for micro-particle solid volume fractions of <measure type="value"><num>0.05</num></measure></p><p>( <measure type="value"><num>Fig. 11</num><measure type="?" unit="a">a</measure></measure>) and <measure type="list"><num>0.1</num></measure> (Fig. 11b). The corresponding critical electric field for the onset of micro-particle Quincke rotation is evaluated as As a general conclusion of the results presented in this article, we find that, in the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> spin viscosity limit, the full continuum governing equations (from anti-symmetric/couple stress theories) employed in this article reduce to a "particulate limit" and predict similar trends of variations of the effective viscosities for Couette flow and of the <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> dimensional volume flow rates for Poiseuille flow as compared to the theoretical predictions from the <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure>-phase volume averaged effective medium model (single particle dynamics based) found in the literature [7][8][9][10][11][12]19] for describing the internal micro-particle electrorotation modified flow phenomena.</p><p><measure type="value"><num>Two</num></measure> dimensional Couette and Poiseuille flows with internal, spontaneous micro-particle electrorotation, or Quincke rotation, are modeled and analyzed through a fully continuum mechanical formulation in this article. By combining the theories of particle electromechanics and continuum anti-symmetric/couple stresses, general governing equations are given to describe the physical aspects of polarization relaxation, mass conservation, momentum conservation, and angular momentum conservation involved in this novel negative electrorheological phenomena.</p><p>With the assumptions of steady, incompressible, fully developed, and <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> dimensional flows, the 32 general governing equations are respectively reduced to <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> algebraic, cubic equations of the ER fluid spin velocity, *  , for the Couette and Poiseuille flow geometries in the limit of a zero spin viscosity in the angular momentum equation. Stability, symmetry, and "free-to-spin" conditions are then applied to the cubic spin velocity equations to pick out or select the real valued solution or combination of solutions consistent with the physical assumptions and phenomena of interest. (ii) The effective viscosity, *  , is found to decrease as the applied DC electric field strength increases for Couette flow with internal particle electrorotation. However, as the driving shear rate becomes large, the amount of reduction in the effective viscosity is reduced regardless of the applied electric field strength. For a decreasing electric field strength, the effective viscosity goes back to the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> electric field solution, * 1   , i.e., the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> field viscosity of the ER fluid (particle-liquid mixture),  .</p><p>(iii)With a constant driving pressure gradient, *  , the magnitude of the normalized Poiseuille spin velocity, *  , as well as the jump or discontinuity in the spin velocity profile increases as the applied electric field, * E , increases whereas the spin velocity reduces back to the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> , as the applied electric field is decreased. At <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> driving pressure gradients, the electrorotation enhanced volume flow rate assumes some finite value because of the fact that we have employed the spin velocity solution that satisfies the symmetry, real valued, stable micro-particle rotation, and free-to-spin conditions in the evaluation of Q under zero spin viscosity conditions.</p><p>(vi) Comparing the results of the Couette effective viscosity and the Poiseuille volume flow rate obtained herein with those found in current literature, we find that both the present continuum and the previous two-phase volume averaged (single particle dynamics based) models qualitatively predict the same trends of variation for the effective viscosity with respect to the electric field strength and average shear rate, and for the volume flow rate with respect to the field strength and driving pressure gradient. The similarities found between the <measure type="value"><num>two</num></measure> modeling approaches suggest that the fully continuum mechanical modeling field equations presented in this article reduces to a "particulate limit" when the spin viscosity in the continuum angular momentum equation equals to zero, i.e., couple stress free conditions. Note however that the theoretical predictions of the Couette effective viscosity and Poiseuille volume flow rate obtained from the present continuum mechanical treatment are in good agreement with the experimental measurements as reported in current literature.</p><p>Future work includes a more advanced modeling of the polarization relaxation processes in the electrorheological fluid flow, the investigation of finite spin viscosity effects on the angular 34 momentum balances within the flow field, and the search of possible practical applications for such novel negative electrorheological phenomenon.
